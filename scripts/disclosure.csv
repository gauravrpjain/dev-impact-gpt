Improved access to finance for MSMEs: The MSME sector is extremely critical for the development of the country as it accounts for over 30% of the GDP and provides employment to more than 110 million people. The Covid-19 pandemic had severely impacted the economic environment for the MSME sector. In particular, commercial vehicle (CV) financing was amongst the worst-hit segments in the financial sector given mobility restrictions and low truck utilization rates. This segment is recovering from the pandemic, and demand for CVs, especially used CVs, remains buoyant given the growing economy, and the focus on infrastructure. The proposed investment would support access to CV finance to MSMEs, particularly micro enterprises, focusing on MSMEs in underserved areas like low-income states and rural regions of India. 

Market impact:

Beyond the project level outcomes, IFC anticipates the investment to promote greater inclusiveness of underserved segments like MSMEs in underserved regions like LIS by demonstrating the commercial viability of serving these segments at scale. The project also supports integration of the securitization market in India, by attracting long term capital from investors."

"17","Home First Debt",47289,2022-10-21 04:00:00,"South Asia","Stakeholders impact: 

Improved access to affordable housing finance and green affordable housing finance: IFC anticipates that the investment will increase retail borrowers' access to housing finance and green housing finance, and encourage homeownership for low-income segments. Rapid urbanization in India has led to several challenges including congestion, pressure on basic amenities, and severe housing shortages in cities, especially in the low-cost segment. 
Limited penetration of green housing is another key challenge in the housing market in India. IFC estimates a total green buildings/housing investment opportunity of US$1.4 trillion in India from 2018 to 2030. 

Market impact:

Competitiveness: IFC's support to the Project, along with IFC's other systematic engagements in the affordable housing segment, will promote greater competitiveness in the affordable housing market in India, including supporting the development of green affordable housing. The housing market in India is very active with both banks as well as NBFCs and HFCs providing housing finance. However, a large proportion of the housing finance focuses on higher income groups, and low and middle-income groups remain unserved/underserved. Although IFC has been supporting the development of affordable housing financiers through continued interventions, the shortage of affordable houses and affordable housing finance is substantial and would require continuous ongoing support.  In this context, the Project will demonstrate the viability of providing housing finance to lower-income groups at scale, and will also support the development of green affordable housing.

The transaction will help farmers to improve crop yields and increase supply of fertilizers and reinforce food and nutrition security. The larger available trade finance lines will allow Nitron to reach a wider range of customers and suppliers.Stakeholder effects: Increased access to fertilizers for farmers: The main stakeholders are local farmers who import fertilizers to grow their crops of agricultural commodities. In 2021, Nitron sold 6.4 million metric tons of fertilizers to LAC. Currently, fertilizer application rates in many LAC and emerging markets are significantly below international averages, which negatively impacts crop yields and farmers profitability. The greater access to fertilizers is of particular importance given the restricted availability of liquidity and the constraints with respect to country/obligor limits in emerging markets.Market Creation:Integration: IFC expects the Facilities, through the demonstration and replication channel, to contribute to the strengthening of financial integration of the fertilizer value chain in the markets where Nitron operates. In this way, Nitron is expected to attract other private sector banks to finance the growth of its trading activity. This would be due to the market's positive reaction to IFC's continued support of Nitron.Resilience: The supply in trade finance, in LAC and elsewhere, has been negatively affected by the declining trends in cross border banking networks.

In 2020, exports of vehicles and vehicle parts amounted to US$22.7 billion, representing 13% of total exports of goods and services. Vehicle parts, in turn, amounted to US$4.6 billion or 3% of total exports. Through the Project, the Company will increase its exports, directly contributing to improving Turkey's current account deficit (CAD)  particularly important amid the volatile macroeconomic context experienced recently by the country. The Project is anticipated to contribute to the Turkish economy by both direct value addition, as well as through indirect effects induced in the value chain. Finally, IFC anticipates that through increased backward linkages, the Project will contribute to indirect employment in Ege Endustri's supply chain.

Integration: The automotive supplier industry is well developed in Turkey. In 2020, overall vehicle parts represented 2.6% of Turkish exports, valued at US$4.6 billion. The most important challenges faced by Turkish automotive suppliers are (i) subdued adoption of new technologies, which may result in lower value-added products and associated decline in margins, given the increase in global demand for technology-based products and (ii) limited strategizing and investment to develop the necessary capabilities and positioning to remain competitive in the future.  It is imperative for the Turkish automotive supplier industry to prepare for the transition from traditional systems to higher-technology adoption, per the market dynamics as global automotive OEMs are ramping up their production of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid engine models. 

Ege Endustri has emerged as one of the leading players among Turkish automotive suppliers, through continuous investment in technology, research and development, cost competitiveness and capacity expansion.  IFC's Project will build on Ege Endustri's ongoing strategy for the electrification of its products. The consolidation in a single facility of two existing plants and adoption of robotic equipment for automated manufacturing technology will enable the Company to achieve economies of scale and increased cost-efficiency, expanding the output capacity to produce axles and suspensions for e-trucks. The success of the Project will provide demonstration effects to other automotive suppliers in Turkey to improve their cost-efficiency, enhance operating standards, and expand capacity for local production of higher-technology products, which can potentially strengthen their forward linkages and integration with global OEMs. The Turkish automotive suppliers will be incentivized to follow suit, amid increasing pressures in the global supply chain as automotive industry leaders gradually increase the electrification of their products.

Improved access to finance for MSMEs: The MSME sector plays a key role in the Indian economy, accounting for over 30% of the GDP and providing employment to more than 110 million people. Overall, the Covid-19 pandemic further intensified the issues around financing MSMEs. Commercial vehicle financing in particular was amongst the worst-hit segments in the financial sector given low vehicle utilization rates. Although MSME financing and CV financing have been recovering and are close to pre-pandemic levels, the recovery remains nascent, and inflationary pressures and supply chain bottlenecks pose a threat to the recovery. Continuing to provide access to finance to MSMEs will be crucial to ensure their sustained recovery from the pandemic. The proposed investment would support access to finance to MSMEs, for purchasing commercial vehicles, focusing on MSMEs in underserved areas like low-income states and rural regions of India.

Firewood represents 99% of primary energy production , where more than 36% of the firewood is used by households for cooking.  Heavy reliance on biomass fuels for household consumption entails severe negative health effects. These fuels are inefficient energy sources and produce a range of pollutants associated with detrimental health outcomes. While replacing biomass with LPG remains a switch to fossil fuels, this change represents an important step in the country's move towards cleaner energy sources. The current use of biomass in Togo is unsustainable and contributes to the country's high levels of deforestation.

"164","Aadhar Debt",46197,2022-04-27 04:00:00,"South Asia","Stakeholder Impact: 
Improved access to affordable housing finance: Rapid urbanization and the lack of affordable housing finance has led to a severe shortage of housing units in urban areas. Recent estimates suggest India's urban housing shortage was 29 million units in 2018, increasing by over 58 percent since 2012. The rural housing shortage also continues to be a concern and is estimated to be twice that of the urban housing shortage as the rural segment is less attractive to private sector developers. Housing financiers have been reluctant to finance the affordable segment due to the difficulties in assessing the debt servicing capacities of low- and middle-income group borrowers and the high costs of servicing such loans. IFC anticipates that this Project will significantly increase retail borrowers' access to housing finance and encourage homeownership for EWS & LIG segments. India's mortgage market depth (outstanding mortgage as % of GDP) is low compared to other emerging economies. Through this Project, and IFC's previous investments, IFC has been supporting the Government of India's initiative of 'Housing for All'.

Increased access to green affordable housing finance: Limited penetration of green housing is another key challenge in the housing market in India. IFC estimates a total green buildings and housing investment opportunity of US$1.4 trillion in India from 2018 to 2030, with the residential sector accounting for US$1.25 trillion (89 percent) of this opportunity. In addition to increasing access to affordable housing finance, the Project will also support Aadhar in growing its green affordable housing portfolio.

Market Impact: 
Competitiveness: The housing market in India is very active, however, a large proportion of the housing finance focuses on high-income or salaried groups, and low & middle-income groups remain unserved/underserved. In the context of green financing, the market for green affordable housing finance remains underdeveloped with a very few HFCs/ financial institutions focused on financing for green building/housing as green finance is considered expensive and thus not meant for the affordable housing segment.

The likelihood assessment is positively influenced by (a) the existing commitment to building these assets after the successful outcome of Celsia Colombia's bid in the two latest power auctions in Colombia, (b) traditionally favorable regulatory sector framework; (c) Celsia Colombia's strong experience developing energy infrastructure in Colombia; and (d) the advanced stage of the analysis of technical and E&S risks. The proceeds of the Facility will be used for several diverse corporate needs. Due to limited visibility at this stage regarding the specific use of proceeds, the project-outcomes assessment is based on an estimate of the potential outcomes focused on supporting Celsia Colombia's development of two wind farms that are a high priority in the Company's expansion CAPEX pipeline. These two projects have a total capacity of 359 MW for a combined generation of 1,329 GW per year (P50).Environmental Effects: The Project is expected to partly support the expansion of Celsia Colombia's renewable energy assets, thus contributing to the improvement of the power sector's carbon footprint in Colombia. The GoC has committed to reducing the Country's GHG emissions by 20 percent below business-as-usual in 2030 under the NDCs submitted as part of the Paris Agreement. The thermal generation currently represents 31 percent of Colombia's installed capacity, and the share of CO2 emissions from the power sector accounted for 27 percent of the country's total emissions in 2014. By supporting Celsia Colombia's pipeline development of two wind farms, the Project is expected to increase by 10x the non-hydro renewable energy generation capacity in Colombia by adding 359 MW to the existing 36 MW. IFC anticipates that the Project will contribute to the country's climate mitigation agenda by supporting the displacement, particularly during drought events, of high polluting thermal power sources such as coal and heavy fuel oil, with non-conventional renewable energy (reducing the associated carbon emissions). The two wind farms are expected to reduce GHG emissions by approximately 411,990 tons CO2 per year once fully operational. To measure progress against this outcome, IFC will track reduced CO2 emissions per year.Stakeholder Effects: IFC anticipates that the Project will support the development of NCRE capacity in the Atlantic Coast region in Colombia. The power supply in this region is notoriously unreliable, with power outages of approximately 96 hours per year, one of the highest in the country and well above the 36 hours national average. La Guajira region is particularly exposed to drought and poorly equipped to meet demand through hydroelectric generation. The wind farms will expand electricity generation capacity in the region to improve the quality of electricity service. IFC's financing proceeds could also be used to finance other projects in the Company's renewable energy pipeline.

Stakeholder effects: IFC anticipates that the Project will support improvement in transport logistics by introducing the first international standard dry port in Laos. Laos is a landlocked country with an underdeveloped logistics services industry and with transport prices twice as high as in other Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states. Prior to the operation of the Project, the cross-border trade in Vientiane was served by the First Friendship Bridge Checkpoint, which suffered from severe capacity constraints and with limited ability to process the increased traffic from the Laos  China Railway. The Project is expected to offer access to advanced logistics services including multimodality, trans-shipment and value-added services with potential cost and time savings. 
Market Creation Integration: The Project is expected to improve integration by establishing a strategic node for trade in the region, as well as setting a precedent for the remaining seven dry ports (Pursuant to art. 8 of Decree No. 513/GOL on Dry Port dated 4 August 2021, there will be a total of 9 dry ports to be constructed including Thanaleng Dry Port in Laos) to be constructed. The lack of strategic inland nodes (dry ports) to facilitate trade between Laos and its neighbors have led to sub-optimal solutions where trade not always moves through the most direct route.

Moreover, SME finance has decreased during 2020-2021 in a period of recession when banks were restricting their loans and going for less risk portfolios. 


IFC anticipates that the Project will contribute to greater resilience in the SME finance market through demonstration and replication channels by unlocking alternative funding sources for lenders in the SME financing segment. The credit market in Brazil is characterized by a high degree of concentration where banks control the lion's share with the top 5 banks responsible for about 70% of the total credit volume in the country. This market dominance enables banks to realize good profits dampening their appetite for targeting underserved segments such as SMEs. Worse still, banks perceive SMEs as a high-risk segment and retrench from this segment especially during stress periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This flight to quality phenomenon was evident during the pandemic as there was a decline of approximately 3% in the share of SME financing by commercial banks in 2021 to 61.7% from roughly 64.7% in 2020.

effectiveness of both the prevention and treatment of diseases. Biopharma drugs
are particularly effective with late-stage, difficult to treat, chronic
diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and hepatitis C, and immunological
disorders. Biologics are better than existing chemical alternatives because
they have higher efficacy outcomes and are more specific in targeting and
hence, have fewer side effects.&nbsp;

The Project responds to the gap
through investing in a Company with capacity to bring biosimilars to developing
countries where there is a low penetration of biologicals due to the high cost
of innovative products and lack of interest of biosimilars producers to go to
these markets.

multinational pharma companies, which were once considered traditional pharma
companies, are now shifting into biotech on an unprecedented scale. However,
most low- and middle-income countries lack access to biopharma products, and at

Project Outcomes:&nbsp;Increased access to quality broadband Internet for
individuals and businesses. Based on the standalone capex plan to upgrade
mobile and fixed network, a preliminary assessment suggests ""Strong""
Project Outcomes, with a risk of a&nbsp;Moderate&nbsp;rating if savings
are not reinvested or if there is no addition with respect to the current capex
plan. The gap in access to quality broadband Internet in Armenia is expected to
be Medium as, compared to other emerging markets, penetration and download
speed of fixed or mobile broadband is on par with regional or income-group
averages. Without the refinancing component, the Company may not be able to
expand beyond its historical investment trend. The refinancing is expected to
generate savings that, if reinvested, can support network expansion and upgrade
as well as expand international connectivity. The magnitude of these outcomes
will be explored in appraisal and depends on: the degree of commitment to
reinvest the savings, and how these will be invested; and the incremental
nature of this investment compared to the existing capex plan.

&nbsp;

Market Creation&nbsp;- Subject to evidence about the expected increase
in high-speed broadband coverage beyond the Company, a preliminary assessment
suggests ""Moderate"" Contribution to Market Creation. Increased
integration by strengthening international connectivity linkages or enabling
digital platforms may be considered post appraisal. Increased competitiveness
of the market for broadband Internet access by preserving trends in network
upgrade via innovation and competition channels. The market for broadband
Internet access in Armenia is fairly developed with a number of large fixed and
mobile broadband operators providing affordable service within an effective
regulatory framework. However, technological innovation remains limited beyond
the market leader as other operators mainly rely on legacy technologies (3G and
ADSL). By supporting an expansion of 4G and fiber-optic network by the Company,
this investment has the potential to maintain competitive pressure on other
market players to continue upgrading their networks, thereby preserving the
trends in broadband quality improvement in the Armenian broadband sector."

In Brazil, credit penetration has been one of the most important issues in financial sector development given the structural barriers and lack of incentives for banks to go down the market. There is a SME finance gap is estimated at $437 billion in Brazil (24.7% of GDP), 3x of the current stock of SME loans outstanding. The economic crisis of the last few years has further accentuated the already considerable finance gap as the MSME portfolio of the Brazilian banking sector has declined from $210 billion as of December 2015 to $124 billion as of September 2020, representing a 16% reduction in local currency. The Project will support Daycoval to continue addressing the financing gaps faced by SMEs in the country, through its targeted focus on underserved segments.IFC anticipates that the Project will contribute to an increased inclusiveness of the SME financing market in Brazil. Historically, the SME financing market has been considered inefficient, due to a number of issues such as lack of financial infrastructure elevating the cost of lending, and the large presence of SOEs limiting competition. The Project ultimately intends to contribute to attenuating the potential flight to quality, or a retrenchment of banks from the SME financing markets, given the higher risk profile of the segment. Daycoval actively participates in the government programs to serve SMEs, while it especially tries to reach beyond general SMEs expanding into underserved segments.

"467","Vatia S.A. ESP",43464,2021-01-19 05:00:00,"Latin America and the Caribbean","Project-level Outcomes- The Project  is expected to improve energy affordability to end-users as large utility companies tend to charge undifferentiated rates or capacity charges to their clients. On the other hand, retailers tend to provide customized offers, which can initiate a change in consumption patterns such as higher off-peak consumption. Off-peak consumption reduces the need for total peak capacity in the country, eventually decreases the need for standby thermal plants, and thereby reduces the associated charges included in end-user tariffs. IFC  also expects the Project to support the country's climate mitigation agenda by improving access to cleaner energy more competitively and efficiently, thereby displacing high polluting, inefficient, and more expensive thermal generation and hence reduce associated carbon emissions.

Contribution to Market Creation- IFC's support to Vatia is expected to demonstrate energy retail companies like Vatia (beyond the incumbent large utility companies) can act as off-takers to renewable energy projects outside of the auction schemes, providing competition on price and service quality on the customer side, while reconciling the long-term certainty needs of renewable energy developers with the short-term certainty needs of end-customers.

Currently there are many shortcomings across Africa in terms of diagnostic services. There are too few laboratories and those that exist often have poor quality control, with a limited variety of tests. The Project will fill these gaps by (1) increasing the number of patients & collection points. The project plans to expand its lab network to new countries, including IDA-PSW-eligible countries. The project will also increase the number of collection points to the periphery of major cities, resulting in an estimated 0.5 million additional patients and 2.3 million additional tests; (2) introducing more accurate & faster tests: Cerba will aim to expand and strengthen CLA's systems, and introduce new technology, that will lead to additional and quicker accurate testing by CLA's pathology labs, reducing costs and the need for multiple tests, and (3) introducing a greater depth of clinical tests into the markets it enters. This will allow for diagnostics of a greater range of diseases, and these diagnostics will support a greater range of treatments. 

Market Impact Assessment - the Project will enable systemic changes by increasing the competitiveness of the diagnostics market in Africa. It will do this by supporting the entry and expansion of CLA into a number of under-developed markets. These markets are characterized by relatively small providers that are under-capitalized and without the systems to ensure consistently accurate tests, as well as by the absence of regulation. CLA's expansion will place pressure on other laboratories to ""up their game"" and will demonstrate the value of its business model and so could lead to replication by other companies.

COVID-19 - African countries have fragile health systems & to fight the pandemic, public authorities will need to engage the private sector.

Brazil has one of the the highest credit card penetration rates in emerging markets, with 26 percent of adults having taken a loan from a financial institution or used a credit card according to the latest Global Findex survey.  Average rates for credit cards (300 percent p.a.) and personal loans (110 percent p.a.) are amongst the highest in the world due to limits in credit data infrastructure and competition.  Through advanced analytics enabling increasingly accurate risk-based pricing, and a lean business model, Geru is able to compete with rates offered by the more competitive banks to their own account holders, offering interest rates on personal unsecured loans lower than the market average by an estimated 16-28%, without requiring any collateral deposits.  With this investment, Geru will seek to grow its customer base by leveraging technology and alternative data to further improve their credit risk underwriting, tailoring terms and expanding product offerings to consumers.  Geru loans are not earmarked for a specific use or investment, approximately 50 percent of Geru borrowers to date, states taking a loan for refinancing purposes by lowering the rates or improving product terms. Of these, a significant share are refinancing credit card debt, one of the most expensive and widespread sources of debt in the market.  2.5	Through a carefully-designed, user friendly online platform, Geru allows consumers to verify eligibility and simulate loan terms tailored to their profile with transparent disclosures. This allows platform users to compare terms with those offered by their bank, and apply for a loan in less than ten minutes. While approval is less likely for applicants flagged in the credit bureau that are typically rejected by main financial institutions, through this project Geru will invest in further developing its algorythms to better discern a customer's previous default history, as well to take advantage of the new data opportunities provided by the emergence of a positive registry and open banking regulation.

Through this project, IFC anticipates the Bank's WSME loan portfolio to grow by 59 percent to US$4.2 billion (from a baseline of US$2.6 billion in 2018), serving 32,170 WSMEs (94 percent increase from a baseline of 16,568 in 2018), thus increasing the share of WSME borrowers as a percentage of total SME borrowers from 37.6 percent to 51.1 percent and growing WSME lending volume as a percentage of total outstanding portfolio from currently 33.7 percent to 37.5 percent in 2026.
Stakeholder effects - improved quality of financial and non-financial products and services for WSMEs: Through this project, IFC will support Krungsri to develop a WSME-centric customer value proposition, which will strengthen the Bank's existing SME business and help expand the Bank's WSME loan portfolio. The project is further expected to benefit WSMEs through additional non-financial services tailored towards WSMEs. 
Economy-wide effects - job creation: If the Bank grows its WSME portfolio as expected, IFC estimates the project will create between 45,000 and 83,000 jobs over the next five years.

Market Creation
Integration: Thai capital markets are considered somewhat developed relative to other emerging economies. The themed-bond market in Thailand is gaining momentum. Krungsri's Women Entrepreneurs Bonds will be the first social bond in the market and the first issuance 100-percent dedicated to WSMEs. IFC therefore anticipates that this new capital market instrument, endorsed and issued by a systemic commercial bank, will demonstrate to other market participants the opportunity of mobilizing funding from private sector investors, and thus enhancing financial market integration. As the first Women Entrepreneurs Bonds in Thailand issued under SBPs and ASBS by a commercial bank, the Project will further contribute to market integration via standard setting channels.
Inclusiveness: IFC anticipates the Project will significantly improve market inclusiveness for WSMEs by supporting a systemically important, publicly listed financial institution with a strong SME business to demonstrate to other market participants a successful pilot case for raising funds to establish an innovative women-centric lending program that will both improve access to finance for WSMEs and demonstrate the financial viability of investing in women entrepreneurs.

Stakeholders Impact 
c) Access to affordable customized agriculture tires to improve mechanization in agriculture and thereby, productivity. Customized tire products (OHT) lead to better traction, lower downtime and result in an increase in higher productivity. The Project will increase availability of value brand products (defined as the brands that are able to offer a quality competitive product at a lower price), which are more affordable than the regular customized tires. 
d) Expanding outreach to more farmers and low-income states (LIS) with better extension services: The Company plans to onboard and extend attractive credit terms to distributors and wholesalers, who are mostly SMEs, to further market the product and enhance awareness of the use of customized tires to farmers. 
e) Better productivity through investments in modern machineries and training; The Company aims to set their level of productivity to be higher than the India industry average and more aligned with the industrial benchmark in Europe and North America, through improvement in machineries and training. 
Market Outcomes:
f) Competitiveness: Increased penetration of value brand OHT in India: Penetration of OHT in India is still relatively lower compared to developed markets such as EU and North America and other emerging markets outside.  The Indian OHT market is less mechanized and more price sensitive due to low farm incomes and as a result the product range in Indian markets is not as specialized as in the EU and North America, where more application specific solutions are available. IFC anticipates more investments in this sector will happen, increasing the degree of customization and product range available, thus resulting in an increased penetration of OHT in India.
g) Integration by way of increased participation by Indian OHT tire players in the global market: The size of OHT segment globally is still relatively small compared to the entire tires industry at ~10% of total tire industry. At present, value brands hold around approximately 30% of the global market share, with Indian players holding half of this market share. Indian players such as the Company have the advantage to produce more of value brand segment of OHT tires, given conversion costs in India are lower than in any other manufacturing bases.

Modernization of the Logistic and Transport Support for the Growth of the Vast Indian Hinterland: The container terminal at Vishakhapatnam is the primary gateway for container traffic for the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The Project will double the existing container handling capacity enabling foreign trade in India's vast hinterland to pass through much more efficiently at lower the cost. The improved port will increase revenues for the government through royalty payments and taxes; more importantly, the increased foreign trade will provide more economic opportunity and create jobs for the people living in the hinterland states.

2.

Lulalend serves customers with annual revenues ranging between ZAR500K and ZAR50MM ($36K - $3.5MM), with an average loan size of ~$10,000. Their primary target customers are those that have less than ZAR10MM ($700K) revenue per year. These firms are below the lending thresholds of traditional banks that typically offer them transactional services and wouldn't be able to access credit from formal sources. 89% percent of Lulalend's customers are estimated to be first time business borrowers.

Lulalend specializes on MSME lending, maintaining low operating costs compared to banks and other full-service providers. We expect the success of Lulalend to contribute to greater competitiveness and innovation in the market through two channels: i) demonstrating the viability of extending credit to smaller MSMEs, leading new entrants, as well as existing financial service providers to emulate its business model and its products, ii) partnering with at least one larger financial institution in South Africa to serve these segments through partnerships or the development of white-label technology solution for serving micro and small enterprises."

"832","Republic Bank Ghana Limited",42193,2019-04-04 04:00:00,"Africa","Stakeholders' Impact:

 - The Project is expected to provide long-term funding to SME borrowers. Longer-term financing is scarce in Ghana, and an especially binding constraint for some SMEs. According to the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, 5% of SMEs did not apply for a loan because maturity levels and loan sizes were inadequate. This is higher than the lower-middle income average of less than 2%.
- The Bank's current average tenor for SME loans is 12 months, and only 21% of loans have maturities over 36 months. The Project will enable the Bank to extend the average tenor of its loans to SMEs to 36 months. It is estimated that 72% of SMEs in Ghana currently do not have access to finance. The SME finance gap expressed as a percentage of GDP in Ghana was 13%, according to the most recent available IFC data (2017) and is likely to have widened over the past year in the context of asset quality issues in the banking sector, which caused banks to curb lending. 
- IFC anticipates that the Project will provide financing for 2,500 additional SMEs, increasing the Bank's SME reach in terms of number of loans to an outstanding portfolio of 4,500 SME loans worth US$330 million by 2023 from US$137 million as of December 2018. The Bank plans to increase the SME share of its overall loan portfolio from 51% as of 2018 to 65% by 2023, through increase in digital channels, leveraging RFHL's experience in providing SME banking to scale up their operations. The Bank's SME loan book is currently focused on the oil and gas, general trading, manufacturing, health, agriculture (non-traditional) and services sectors which make up about 80% of the Bank's SME loan book.

 Environmental and Social Impact: 

- Climate finance is a relatively new concept for banks in Ghana, with just a few banks in the country exploring green building finance.  However, the growth of climate finance has faced challenges primarily because of constraints of inadequate long-term funding and lack of dedicated incentives for developers. 
- Against this backdrop, Ghana's INDC states that the country needs US$22.6 billion to deliver on the Ghanaian government's climate commitments in accordance with the Paris Agreement. By on-lending over longer terms to an overlooked borrowing sub-segment in the country, the Project is expected to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 14,697.65 tons CO2. IFC will assist the Bank in defining its green finance strategy, identifying climate-eligible projects and training its staff in the areas of energy efficiency, climate-smart agriculture, and green buildings. 
- With 25% of the senior loan targeted at climate smart SMEs these stakeholders will benefit from access to longer tenured facilities for climate smart projects. 

Market Impact Assessment: 
Competitiveness:
 - Through a replication channel, the Bank's on-lending of longer-term finance to SMEs, with a focus on climate-smart SMEs, is expected to demonstrate to the wider local market that these are attractive investment subsegments.
 - As a mid-tier bank, the Bank is a seen as a market leader for smaller banks, which tend to follow its lead in the market. In addition, the rebranding exercise which took place in April 2018 has positively influenced the Bank's competitive position in Ghana, prompting both local and international banks operating in Ghana to begin following the Bank closely to ensure they can proactively respond to any new trends, products, and innovations introduced by the Bank, which leverages lessons from its parent, RFHL.
 - To this end, it is expected that the Bank's strategy to grow its SME book (including climate-smart SMEs) will be replicated by many of its competitors to keep up with the market."

"876","Mazar IPP Afghan",35413,2019-02-01 05:00:00,"Middle East","The most significant expected project-level impact stems from increased access to electricity resulting from the addition of 58.56MW of generation capacity in a country with significant power shortage. Beyond the Project, IFC anticipates that the Project has potential to promote greater market competitiveness by supporting the country's first IPP and improve resilience through the use of indigenous resources to supply electricity. The key impacts of the Project are summarized below. Project-level outcomes Stakeholder effects - The Project is expected to add about 58.56MW of generation capacity and help address the country's energy demand. Currently, almost two-thirds of the population does not have access to grid connected electricity. The country has one of the lowest per capita electricity consumptions in the world with most firms identifying the lack of electricity as a critical constraint to business development. IFC anticipates that the Project will boost domestic power supply by 30 percent and supply electricity to about 1 million people. Contribution to market creation IFC's investment and advisory interventions, as well as the IDA guarantee and advisory support to GoIRA will help create a new market for private participation and PPPs infrastructure in Afghanistan, not just for IPPs. This could in the first instance be extended beyond thermal IPPs to renewables projects, particularly in solar and wind, for which Afghanistan has potential. IFC's involvement in structuring of this transaction should help make this Project bankable and balanced, and also create a template for future similar IPPs in the country. The Project is also helping create a commercial market for sale and purchase of indigenous natural gas in Afghanistan, which has been non-existent to date, and can contribute to addressing the nation's fiscal and external imbalances. The Project aims to pay a reasonable commercial price for natural gas, providing MoMP with the funds to reinvest in upstream and midstream gas supply projects in the future. Competitiveness - IFC anticipates that the Project could lead to a significant increase in market competitiveness by introducing a pioneering market enabling framework and a bankable contractual structure for private sector participation in the infrastructure space. Currently there are no private sector players in the power sector. The Project, if successful, will demonstrate the viability of private sector participation in the infrastructure sector, which is expected to encourage other potential investors to enter this untapped market that has significant growth potential. Resilience - The Project is expected to contribute to the GoIRA's energy objective of diversifying the country's energy supply, particularly by harnessing indigenous resources to supply electricity. Currently, about 80 percent of power supply is imported through short-term import contracts from Central Asian neighbors. IFC anticipates that the Project will lower the country's energy import bill and reduce reliance on imports, thereby enhancing the country's energy security."
"877","Republic Bank TT",41828,2019-01-31 05:00:00,"Latin America and the Caribbean","Project Outcomes
(i) Stakeholder Effects: (a) Increased access to residential housing finance: Due to the continued growth in housing demand, most recent estimates indicate a shortage of more than 100,000 units, which is significant for a country with a population of less than 1.4 million;  and (b) Increased affordability in housing finance: In T&T wages have not been able to keep pace with the sharp increases in housing prices; thus, households' purchasing power has significantly eroded. For the last two decades the housing affordability ratio in T&T has been at 10:1 vs. international rates of median housing, where a ratio above 4:1 indicates a serious lack of affordability. In this context, RBL is expanding its focus on catering to the middle-income segments where affordability has historically been a major barrier to home ownership.
(ii) Economy Wide Effects: Many of the mortgages supported by the Project are expected to finance new homes; hence, the impact on jobs could be significant. The IFC model estimates the creation of approximately 2.7 jobs per newly built housing unit financed and the value-added impact per housing unit financed to be approximately US$165,000.

Contribution to Market Creation
(i) Competitiveness: Given that RBL is the largest player in the banking sector, the Project will support the Bank as they continue their expansion strategy into the middle-income residential mortgage market, which is expected to contribute to changing the banking sector's risk perception of the segment. Over time other financial institutions will replicate RBL's approach and cater to the growing housing finance demand from middle-income borrowers."

1.1. SF is playing a key role in creating entry level jobs for people coming into the delivery sector. Drivers are trained by SF and have an opportunity to learn how to work with customers across different categories. There is high driver turnover in this sector, with drivers moving across platforms. Drivers, with skill sets developed through SF have the opportunity of being hired by large employers such as Amazon, Flipkart that offer a career path (at fulfilment centers, etc.) in addition to the upward mobility SF offers its drivers.
1.2. Driver payouts on SF are about 40% higher than their most recent jobs and comparable options in delivery logistics since they have increased access to delivery opportunities and improved capacity utilization (current estimate of idle load rides in last mile logistics is 60%).
1.3. Drivers can also opt to work part time by choosing to deliver orders during certain time slots. This provides them flexibility and   helps in supplementing their regular income. SF also offers drivers an option of collecting payouts on a weekly/ biweekly basis, which is not common in the unorganized last mile delivery market, and digital payments to drivers further decreases informality

2. Market Impact: SF contributes to market creation by (i) tech-enabling the sector and developing innovations in key aspects of logistics (example reverse logistics) and by (ii) systematically training delivery staff. IFC believes that SF is best placed to improve this market compared to incumbents and competing platforms due to its superior technological integration and optimization capabilities. As the Company scales and aggregates more drivers and customers onto its platform, it is expected that its digital platform will increase price transparency and efficiency in the broader sector. Other competitors and aggregators will be forced to compete on pricing and improve their game with regards to their technological capabilities and product offering or risk losing market share. Additionally, it is expected that the role of brokers and intermediaries in the sector will diminish, which will improve overall price transparency and efficiency. While the sector has already undergone some consolidation, IFC anticipates that this will continue as SF emerges as the dominant platform in the sector. Through a demonstration effect, new platforms that have the same level of technological sophistication as SF could emerge, which will foster more competition as the platforms compete to take market share by constantly improving service standards and driving down market wide logistics costs. Furthermore, SF will help grow the relatively nascent ecommerce last mile logistics sector. While the demand for last mile delivery has grown tremendously over the past years (driven by the rise in ecommerce), the market is still in the process of being created.

3. Helping SMEs:   SF currently serves enterprise clients and independent SMEs including small retail stores, small local restaurants and franchisee outlets of restaurant chains. It provides an efficient and distributed hyperlocal logistics platform to SMEs for serving evolving customer needs of faster and cheaper product delivery through an online to offline channel (O2O model). SF offers prices that are 30%-40% cheaper and aims to increase their access to markets in Tier II, III and IV cities by giving them the option to deliver next day to customer.  By helping SMEs with an online presence provide the same level of service as large retailers, SF can help make these SMEs more competitive. SF is currently in 80+ cities in India and is rapidly and actively increasing its geographic coverage - as of FY17, they were in 20+ cities. SF has served ~7,000 SMEs since inception and is targeting to reach to 100,000 SMEs by 2022."

Stakeholder effects - IFC anticipates that the Project will help address some of the supply shortage in the country, especially in Sumatra. The Project is among the first batch of gas-fired IPPs being tendered by PLN under the ""35GW Program"", a national policy priority to scale up generation capacity. The supply of power in Indonesia has not been able to keep pace with rapid electricity demand, and the project will help address some of the supply shortage in the country by adding 275MW of generation capacity.
 Environmental effect: The Project will add to the thermal generation capacity in Indonesia. There could be a potential net a reduction in the CO2 intensity in the island if the plant displaces more polluting sources of generation but needs to be substantiated. 

Contribution to market creation 
Competitiveness - The Project could contribute to market competitiveness by supporting a local private player expand their market share. The Project also represents the first entry into the Indonesia power generation space by the Thai JV partner - a leading IPP in Thailand. The total installed power generation capacity in Indonesia at the end of 2015 was 55.5GW, of which 38.9GW (70 percent) is state-owned.

"943","Cruzeiro Growth",41309,2018-07-18 04:00:00,"Latin America and the Caribbean","Project Level: The Project will mostly benefit students as the main stakeholders of educational institutions. By financing Cruzeiro's expansion, the University can increase the supply of quality education programs for those acquired institutions. Though Cruzeiro always maintains the name and characteristics of the regional university, Cruzeiro can add product diversity, bringing their high scored quality programs to the acquired institutions (subject to regulatory review). This has been done previously by Cruzeiro, increasing enrollment. Cruzeiro has committed to raising the standards of the acquired universities, requesting accreditation if the university lacks it, so the acquired university will be homologous to existing Cruzeiro accredited entities. Cruzeiro can provide virtual education undergraduate degrees, if not offered by the acquired institutions. They have a competitive advantage in virtual education, being the third largest provider of virtual education in the country, with some programs ranked at the top level, like human resources management or public policy. The students in these regions will benefit from the much lower tuition rates of distance learning, at 67% lower cost than tuition in presence studies, with the recognition of the Cruzeiro brand and quality. These students, mostly working adults, will now be able to attend tertiary studies, for they can adapt to the flexible hours that distance learning allows, and can afford tuition out-of-pocket, without the need of financial aid or government loans. The acquired universities will also improve their operational and administrative standards, by accessing the platform of shared services that connects all Cruzeiro institutions (e.g. virtual library with +300,000 titles and electronic documents, employability tools to aid in the mandatory internship search (estgio), academic content online for a myriad of courses).

Market Creation: This Project will create competitive pressure in quality tertiary education, in the geographical regions where Cruzeiro currently operates and in the newer geographies where it is expanding, either by acquisitions or by setting up virtual education centers (polos). In the economic slowdown affecting Brazil, many youths in the 18-34-year age bracket are working rather than studying. Cruzeiro is expanding the market by providing the option of tertiary education to a population that was discouraged to enroll, due to the higher costs and demanding hours. Between the Northeast and South areas, there are 8.6m potential students in this age bracket, with no higher education degree. Cruzeiro has regulatory approval to open 750   distance centers nationwide (in addition to the existing 505 that they currently operate), that could cater to this population, and double enrollment. Cruzeiro began its distance offering recently, in 2015, and has rapidly reached 111,800 students, becoming the third largest player, with an estimated 8% share of this student enrollment. It can demonstrate the path for other universities to follow for high standards in distance learning and provide a quality service to students. These high standards are exemplified with Cruzeiro's use of innovative learning methods, used to build capacity in all its programs. Cruzeiro uses advanced technology tools like Blackboard, chatBots, machine learning and predictive analytics to upload/download content, control attendance and testing, reduce drop-out rates, improve tutoring sessions. Cruzeiro raises the quality levels of distance learning; it has 11% of its distance courses certified with the highest course score grade of 5 and 73% certified with a grade of 4. Cruzeiro enhances the campus experience in virtual education, providing use of its infrastructure to students enrolled in virtual education (libraries, IT centers, community space, 70 physical tutors on sites, all testing on site)."

-	The Project shall support HKL's financial capacity to increase local currency (""LCY"") financing therefore leading to improved quality of finance better suited to the needs of MSMEs particularly women, farmers and borrowers in rural areas leading to increased economic activity. Hence it will likely help create indirect employment and jobs and contribute towards the World Bank Group's goal of reaching Universal Financial Access by 2020. 

Market Impact Assessment:
-	Integration: The Project will help develop a corporate bond market in Cambodia through market enabling channel, which will help mobilize domestic savings in LCY, and promoting local currency usage. 
-	IFC's investment in the first LCY bond issued by a MDI would support the creation of the domestic corporate bond market through demonstration of a new viable source of medium to long term LCY debt instrument. The local currency bond issuance would create a bond pricing benchmark in KHR. Additionally, an IFC offshore KHR issuance would also help to catalyze capital market development.
-	Increased usage of LCY financing would help lead to gradual de-dollarization. A high level of dollarization (i) increases the vulnerability of banks with respect to liquidity risk and (ii) limits the scope of the country's exchange rate and monetary policies. Promoting the use of LCY indirectly helps contribute towards a higher degree of exchange rate flexibility in the medium term, which would help the economy regain competitiveness in the context of US Dollar appreciation under dollarization."

"999","LLP Colombia",40982,2018-04-24 04:00:00,"Latin America and the Caribbean","Project-level Impacts
(i) Increased Availability of logistics infrastructure and reduced supply chain costs for businesses - The Project will add ~160,000 sqms of Class A+ storage and distribution capacity (252,000 if total park is considered) to support the efficient development of the supply chains of manufacturers, retailers/e-tailers and associated third-party logistics providers. Class A+ warehousing parks involve large, modern, flexible and well-located buildings and service infrastructure, conceived to optimize distribution configurations and facilitate scale, throughput and consolidation of inventories and transportation. They offer increased availability of docking ports with levelers for all types of trucks, matched with ample maneuvering yards for large vehicles; the buildings have 12 meters of higher ceilings, increased floor load capacity, long and column free span areas, which together significantly increase the number of pallet positions per unit of GLA when compared to existing Class A, B and C. Common services such as security, maintenance, shared cafeterias and training centers, result in further benefits for tenants. Such advantages of Class A+ structures provide tangible benefits to the typical LLP tenants, retailers/e-tailers, manufacturers and 3PLs. Some examples are:- Scalable Class A+ warehouses allow retailers to consolidate all stocks (which typically have been in multiple sites) into a single larger and more efficient warehouse, reducing total warehousing stocks.- Similarly, the retailers' suppliers (generally manufacturers) can simplify their distributions into larger and more frequent deliveries to one central location, instead of small and numerous deliveries to multiple locations (stores and multiple distribution centers), reducing their stocks and better optimizing manufacturing set-ups.- Such broad retail-manufacturing supply-chain reconfigurations, are estimated to result in material savings equivalent to up to 1.0-2.0% of retailers' revenues.  
(ii) Economy-wide effects - The Project will foster the creation of direct jobs during both the construction and operation of properties.  During construction, the Project will support approximately 600 direct jobs. Further, approximately 1,200 direct and indirect jobs will be created during the operational phase. The Project will support a significant number of indirect jobs through the supply chains, including the sourcing construction inputs and related services during the development phase and the sourcing of products and services to be sold within completed properties.
(iii) Positive Environmental Impact: LLP has committed to achieve EDGE certification, which results in at least 20% savings in energy, water and in materials consumption compared with benchmarks for equivalent buildings. 

Market-level Impacts
(i) Competitiveness: The Project will provide a positive impact in the local warehousing and industrial property market.  As of today, Class A warehousing parks in Colombia stand at 450,000 sqm -or 4% of total existing supply. In addition, the Project will be the first of Class A+ quality. Given its modern, efficient, and lower cost characteristics, it is expected that LLP will set high industry standards and demonstrate the economic viability of a further refined business model.
(ii) Sustainability:  Currently, the penetration of modern and energy-efficient industrial warehouses in Colombia is negligible. The buildings built under the Project will achieve global best practice in energy efficiency standards and, will be the first Green Building certified warehousing properties in the country."
"1000","PickMe",41053,2018-04-23 04:00:00,"South Asia","1.	Impact on the Sri Lankan Venture Capital ecosystem: The Sri Lankan start-up ecosystem is nascent and, while seed funding is generally available, there is a lack of institutional funding for Series A onwards. Outside of the software sector, connections and exposure to other more developed ecosystems (e.g. Silicon Valley, India, Singapore) is limited. The government is making efforts to promote entrepreneurship through promotion of networking events, incubators etc. by bodies such as Startup Sri Lanka and SLASSCOM. Due to the small scale of the ecosystem, there is a lack of mentors/advisors to assist young entrepreneurs in starting and growing their businesses. The success of PickMe would have a strong demonstration effect which is expected to foster entrepreneurship and attract both entrepreneurs and institutional investors to Sri Lanka. 

2.	Impact on drivers as SMEs: PickMe has a positive impact on its drivers, through increased earnings, financial inclusion and training. As outlined above, the Company provides drivers with an opportunity to double their earnings by reducing idle time spent waiting for customers. PickMe contributes to financial inclusion and literacy as it requires its drivers to open bank accounts, through which they can receive real time payment transfers, which enables them to begin building a credit history. PickMe also provides training to its drivers on customer service which enhances their self-esteem and status in society as they can interact in a more professional manner with customers. 

3.	Convenient, reliable, and affordable transportation: As there are limited attractive transportation options for Sri Lankan consumers, especially women who do not own their own vehicles. PickMe enables consumers to move around cities in a safe, convenient, reliable and affordable manner. Consumers using a vehicle hailed through PickMe are safer than consumers using vehicles hailed informally as (i) PickMe checks that vehicles are adequately insured to carry passengers and (ii) the PickMe app includes a SOS button that gives the rider an option of alerting the police in case of an emergency. A 2015 survey commissioned by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) revealed that 90 per cent of women in Sri Lanka have experienced sexual harassment on public transport, while only 4 per cent sought help from the Police. These barriers pose a threat to gender parity, the physical and mental wellbeing of women, as well as female labor force participation, which is currently at only 35 per cent, significantly lower than some other countries in the region."
"1001","Omera LPG",40464,2018-04-20 04:00:00,"South Asia","1.	Stakeholders Effects: 
a)	Customers effects: Currently, about 90% of natural gas in Bangladesh is used to generate electricity, with demand from both domestic household and industrial segments expected to grow substantially. However, there is a daily shortage of natural gas of approximately 1,000 million cubic feet (mmcft/day) which might cause major disruptions to the economic activities if remain unaddressed. Due to the shortage of natural gas, LPG is even more needed now especially by the domestic households as natural gas is increasingly diverted for industrial and power sector use. The Project will help minimize the shortage gap and address the lack of storage facilities that have become the bottleneck in the distribution chain by increasing the storage capacity at various stages in the value chain. The other bottleneck is in the downstream logistic services, where certain locations are hard to reach or that the transport lead time is long, both due to the constraints in the transportation infrastructure. The Project will help smoothen the distribution of LPG to the end users by constructing capacity barges, cylinder carrying barges, and upgrading the LPG road tankers fleet. This will direct and indirectly increase the reliability of supply by shortening the delivery time and lowering the transportation costs, and to ensure end customers will have access to LPG when they need them. 

b)	Distributors effects: OPL has established a strong distribution channel with more than 200 distributors across the country. OPL is now present in more than 22,000 retail points in the country, and has presence in all the administrative sub-districts of Bangladesh. The project will increase economic activity of these distributors and retailers, most of them MSMEs, due to the higher volume of LPGs and number of cylinders being distributed to the end users. By 2020, additional 2.1 million cylinders will have been distributed to the market and by 2018, additional 3,000 retailers will have been added to the distribution network. 
 
2.	Contribution to Market Creation: 
a)	Resilience: The project will help create a more resilient energy system through promotion of supply diversification, by helping a private sector player such as OPL deliver LPG to the market. The Project also supports the Government of Bangladesh's policy to dedicate the natural gas production to power generation and industrial consumption, which are currently facing erratic and short supplies. Allocating more natural gas to power generation and fulfil the demand of the household segment with LPG will not only create a more resilient energy system but also lead to better manufacturing productivity and thus generate greater economic value from scarce natural gas resources.

b)	Sustainability:  This project will support the promotion of LPG which has low greenhouse gas emission characteristics when compared to for example, conventional cooking fuels such as firewood, kerosene and charcoal.  Usage of these conventional cooking fuels have reduced drastically in rural Bangladesh, but represent still around 75% of the consumption of cooking fuels, so there is a big potential for LPG to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient cooking emits greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, and aerosols such as black carbon. Better access to LPG in rural areas of Bangladesh through new distribution networks will provide a cleaner and efficient fuel than biomass, reducing overall emissions and thereby improving overall health of the local population. Unlike firewood and charcoal, LPG is easy and instantaneous to light, easy to control so that the required rate of heating can be obtained. LPG does not produce any smoke or soot therefore in overall is more environmentally friendly and sustainable compared to conventional cooking fuels."

The Project will foster the creation of direct jobs during both the construction and operation of properties. The project will also support a significant number of indirect jobs through the supply chain.

The Project assets, once developed, will constitute an attractive pool of matured, institutional-quality property assets that are expected to be aggregated into a portfolio. This portfolio of matured assets as it evolved will become a significant private or public REIT-platform, thus contributing to debottlenecking the evolution of this still embryonic property-based financial market in India.

A.1. Stakeholder Impact
A.1.1. Increase in number of SME suppliers reached: Bizongo has more than 2500 registered SMEs, allowing smaller offline players to integrate better into the market.
A.1.2. Increased capacity utilization of SME suppliers by providing access to larger customers: Many SMEs in this sector lack professional expertise to market and distribute products, leading to low (less than 50%) capacity utilization. Bizongo is able to provide incremental demand and process knowhow which has led some suppliers to increase capacity utilization, significantly improving efficiency.
A.1.3. Improved financial sustainability of the SME suppliers through shorter working capital cycles: Suppliers are better able to manage their business financially due to shorter working capital cycles - since they no longer need to approach buyers individually - which leads to lower working capital needs and better inventory and time management. Customer acquisition costs are also decreased.
A.2. Economic Impact
A.2.1. Improved Employment: Bizongo currently gives jobs to ~110 employees directly (of which women are ~30%). Increased order volumes for suppliers could also lead to more employment within the SME packaging sector.
B. Market Impact
B.1. Improve efficiency and innovation by aggregating a highly fragmented industry: Bizongo contributes to market creation by consolidating and tech-enabling the packaging sector, which is currently fragmented and largely unorganized, with more than 30k registered packaging companies, out of which 85% are MSMEs.

- Cambodia: The Project entails the transfer of knowledge and technical expertise as well as foreign direct investment from China to Cambodia, developing a stronger South-South value chain in the forestry and wood products sector. As a supplier to demanding U.S. and Canadian markets with stringent industry standards, Morris is well-placed to disseminate these practices to less developed countries. The adoption of best industry practices is expected to strengthen technological capacity and bring process improvements to the furniture industry in Cambodia, improving competitiveness at a larger scale than what is currently prevalent in the country. 

- China: In addition, the China component of the Project will help the Company achieve even greater economies of scale in China, leading to more competitive products for domestic consumption as well as export markets. The planned expansion in China is expected to increase the Company's production by 30%.  

Employment Generation and Standards Setting: 
- Cambodia: The transfer of export-quality furniture manufacturing knowledge and technology from China to Cambodia will go hand in hand with creating jobs in Cambodia and improving the skill base of the local labor force, thus raising overall productivity in the sector. The Project is expected to help create viable long term skilled and semi-skilled direct labor opportunities for approximately 800 people at the Cambodian operating facility as well as additional employment along the supply chain. The Project is also expected to help the Company pursue an ethical work program and contribute to improved labor conditions in Cambodia though the application of IFC's Performance Standards. 

- China: A sizeable number of direct jobs will also be created in China as a result of the Project. The Company's operations are fairly labor-intensive and the new facilities will require about 2,200 new employees. Over the longer term, the number of jobs and their skills level may evolve if the Company undertakes the recommended automatization which would improve resource use efficiencies.  

The Project has the potential to generate market level impacts by supporting the development of the nascent furniture industry in Cambodia and helping to integrate the country into more diversified global value chains. In particular:

- Cambodian industrial production is characterized by a narrow base, low level of technological sophistication, low value addition, and high concentration in only a few sectors (notably textiles and footwear, which represent approximately 80% of merchandise exports). Against this backdrop, a Chinese company diversifying its manufacturing base to Cambodia would help a country which is eager to both move up the manufacturing value chain as well as diversify over-reliance on textiles and garments. To help the country's manufacturing sector, Cambodian authorities have established the new Industrial Development Policy (IDP) 2015-2015, which provides a roadmap to boost investment and broaden the manufacturing base. 

- The proposed Project would build a new production facility in Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone (SSEZ) in line with IDP's vision. By undertaking a phased approach that starts with textile-based production (sofa covers) the Company is utilizing Cambodia's existing comparative advantages but is planning to invest in training and skill-building necessary to transition to furniture manufacturing and assembly. A successful outcome of the project is expected to demonstrate to international investors that Cambodia is a viable place of origin for high quality furniture and potentially attract new players. Furthermore, the Project is expected to have a positive impact on the local economy by upgrading the domestic manufacturing industry, diversifying exports, and integrating the country into new global value chains, thus strengthening its resilience to economic shocks."

"1142","Fenglin III",39801,2017-09-13 04:00:00,"East Asia and the Pacific","(1) Private sector development: Continued investments from IFC in successful and scalable companies like Fenglin contribute to the development and consolidation of fragmented forestry and wood panel industries in China, particularly in Guangxi Province, a frontier region where the local economy depends heavily on the industry. Fenglin would continue adopting good practices and high standards for its business practices, such as implementing a laser measuring system for scrap woods delivered to its gate, which allows a more objective and prompt way to compensate its suppliers; introducing higher value-added and innovative products to the market using its in-house R&D work; and adopting international standards and systems in its operations, thereby setting a demonstration effect for the industry as a whole.

(2) Farmers' reach and local economy: The Project would procure at least around 363,000 tons of scrap wood per year directly and indirectly from local forestry farmers in Guangxi Province. This helps to stimulate economic activity among local forestry households, create additional income for them and directly improve their livelihoods. In addition, the Project will procure about 90% more chemicals, such as formaldehyde and urea from local SME suppliers, providing them with more business opportunities.

(3) Environmental impact: The Project would help to raise the industry environmental standards in China through the use of advanced technologies for particle board production including a new air emission system. The new plant would have capability to produce boards with formaldehyde free adhesive on a large scale and continuous basis when the market demands such products, which is currently rare in the industry in China. The Project would also help productively utilize scrap wood that would otherwise be burnt for cooking, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Project is a sustainable solution to resolving the issues of diminishing wood supply and scrap wood waste, and creates a positive impact on the local forestry industry.

- Job preservation and creation of new jobs: The MSME segment plays a key role in Bangladesh's economy contributing to economic growth and employment. Particularly women entrepreneurs face constraints in accessing credit, inhibiting employment generating growth. Through removing these financial barriers, inclusive growth can be extended within typical women dominated segments, creating more female employment. In addition, women employment is more likely to generate positive externalities as they are more inclined to invest profits in the health and education of their families.
- Demonstration effect: Women-owned businesses are less likely to be banked because they tend to be smaller and less formal. The socio-cultural environment where men are still regarded as the heads of the household owning land and property of the family makes it difficult for women to present assets as collateral to access finance. While banks perceive women-owned businesses to be higher risk, they often do not recognize the economic and social benefit of banking women-owned businesses, who tend to be more loyal customers, less price sensitive and more risk averse. Through IFC's gender specific investment, which will be the first one of its kind in Bangladesh, BRAC Bank and IFC can create a positive demonstration effect, encouraging other Financial Institutions to follow."

The IFC loan will be directed to finance recent and ongoing capital expenditures in architectural and automotive glass production in emerging markets, likely Poland and Brazil. Increased production will not only stimulate the construction and automotive sectors but also boost the intermediate industries in its supply chain. The multiplier effect of this process will generate greater economic activity, increase economic complexity and competiveness thus providing a momentum for emerging markets to progress along in their development path.

- Industrial Competitiveness, Productivity and Jobs: The Project will introduce new energy efficient technology to the Company's operations, helping address the urgent need for cold repairs and equipment upgrades which is required every 18 to 20 years to stay competitive in the glass manufacturing sector.  This type of investment is necessary to improving productivity and competitiveness and maintaining the current job levels.  Specifically for NSG UK Poland: (i) since the 1990s, the Company has continuously been adding jobs to the Polish economy, starting with about 300 in the early years and having more than 3,500 today.  The new investment will create more than  200 additional jobs (many of them highly skilled) of which at least 25% are expected to be women employees.  (ii) The greater impact however is in the job preservation.  The cold repair is needed to keep the float line running.  Without this investment, the float operations cannot sustain the level of existing jobs.  (iii) In the downstream investment, the service centers are expected to be extended to under developed regions of Poland, thus creating employment opportunities in such areas.  (iv) NSG UK Poland operations include European Shared Service Center for NSG Group employing 160 highly qualified jobs, of which 95% are occupied by female employees. At a time when these investments are needed, IFC can support the Company in maintaining these critical jobs along the supply chain, while at the same time promoting innovation and know-how transfer. For example, the Project will also include R&D investments primarily undertaken in the Company's R&D facilities in the UK, however, geared towards improvements in the manufacturing process in emerging markets (Poland and Brazil) with the view to make them more efficient and for the development of innovative energy efficient product

This is particularly relevant for insurers with life businesses, which take long-term liabilities to provide life coverage to their policyholders and therefore seek long-term assets to invest into. Through the acquisition of CIL (a former IFC investee company, now AXA Life Egypt), AXA Egypt is expected to be a formidable player in Egypt''s life insurance space.2) Buttressing the Health Sector: AXA Egypt will enter the health insurance market and explores options to engage at a later stage in Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) services. This will contribute to closing the service gap as a growing middle class is seeking better healthcare and are expected to turn to privately run health care providers and insurers. The availability of sufficient private health care providers will lower overall private health care cost and make it more affordable for many upwardly mobile Egyptians to move out of the public health care system. This in turn is expected to unburden the public health care system, creating less stress on the limited resources of public health care.3) Support to SMEs: AXA Egypt aims to launch standardized, but adaptable SME insurance packages, thereby providing insurance cover to SMEs in a more cost-effective manner and ensuring this growing segment of the Egyptian economy.4) Support of Societies in Transition: Societies in transition and going through upheavals are in great need for risk management services so that individuals can be offered a safety net and can improve their social stability.

In particular by:(i) Providing last mile access: the Company distributes social grants to more than 10 million beneficiaries on behalf of the SASSA and operates more than 10,000 cash-out points via a fleet of truck-based ATMs and a network of retail points of sale that can operate in remote areas without internet connectivity(ii) Financial Inclusion: The Company has been working with social grant recipients for almost 20 years and has developed a strong understanding of this customer segment. In July 2015, Net1 introduced a new transaction account platform, the EasyPay Everywhere or ""EPE"" platform, which is directed at the low-income segment of the population. The service and transaction fees associated with the EPE account are among the lowest in the South African market. (iii) Affordable financial services: Net1''s transaction account offering is complemented with micro-loans and life insurance products.

The above HFCs are exclusively focused on providing access to housing finance to low income borrowers, specifically those employed in the informal sector such as self-employed micro-entrepreneurs and un-organized sector salaried workers. This segment is largely ignored by the large HFCs and Banks owing to perceived higher risk profile of such borrowers and difficulty in credit assessment. IFC''s investment will directly expand the availability of housing finance to the low income and relatively excluded customer segments. -	Job Creation: The construction industry is one of the largest employers of labour in urban India and affordable housing is the most labour intensive construction, providing high potential for employment opportunity to the urban poor.

Furthermore, the Project will support the development of the insurance sector in Chile and the region. Increased insurance coverage allows households, companies and investors to assume more risk than would otherwise be possible on their own, while protecting productive assets and income. In addition, insurers deploy long-term funds into the economy, allowing for long-term fund accumulation, thus supporting economic development and infrastructure build-up. This is particularly relevant for insurers such as Consorcio with a strong life insurance business, which take on long-term liabilities to provide life coverage to their policyholders and therefore seek long-term assets to invest in. Finally, part of the Project's funds will be used to support Consorcio's south-south expansion strategy.

"1503","Lionbridge Loan",37919,2016-02-24 05:00:00,"East Asia and the Pacific","1. Promoting financial inclusion: Despite MSMEs being the primary source of growth and employment, MSMEs typically cannot get sufficient affordable financing because of subscale operation and lack of real property (e.g. land, plant), which commercial banks require as collaterals. Leasing has become the most important funding source for MSMEs as it is based on moveable assets, e.g. trucks, machines, equipment, in Lionbridge''s case. In the past, MSMEs could only rely on guarantee companies to get access to short term bank loans, which exposed them to volatility of funding, risk of sustainable operation given the mismatch in the tenure of funding and the life of operation machine/ equipment, as well as a bottleneck in expansion. The proposed project will effectively help Lionbridge Leasing diversify funding sources, improve funding stability and utilization, reach out to more MSMEs and expand credit to them. It is expected that Lionbridge will reach additional 20,000 MSMEs by 2020. 2. Promoting healthy development of the financial leasing sector: the financial leasing industry in China is nascent and for a number of financial leasing companies, the transactions are related to shadow banking. On the contrary, Lionbridge was able to serve the underserved segment with a true leasing model, where the leases are repaid by the cash flow generated by the leasing asset. The success of Lionbridge will set a good example for the whole industry and help establish the right culture and mindset for the industry players, MSME clients, regulatory parties and investors, thus promote the long-run development of leasing sector in China.3. Job creation: the integrated logistics service will enable Lionbridge to recruit truck drivers to deliver the transportation services with Lionbridge''s trucks under financial lease model. Lionbridge has over 1,000 trucks now and targets to expand to 30,000 trucks in 3-5 years, which will create at least 30,000 jobs in the future.4.

However, access to basic healthcare remains deficient, if not absent, for many in developing countries including India. To address this issue, public spending on healthcare has increased in many countries, but supply has not kept pace with the demand, which is driven by a growing and aging population. Consequently, the private sector is playing a significant and expanding role in providing healthcare services in developing economies as witnessed in India The World Bank Group seeks to engage the private sector to increase and improve access to affordable, quality health services, particularly in underserved geographies such as low-income states and Tier 2/3 cities, while reducing the burden of out of pocket health care expenditures.-Affordable access to eyewear products in underserved geographies: With this fundraise, the Company intends to expand its distribution via franchisee partners to more than 100 Tier 2/3 cities in India. -Increase in consumers reached: The Company''s eyewear products reached 600,000 consumers in the year FY15 and this number is expected to increase to more than 5 million by FY21, supported by the expansion undertaken as part of this project.-Employment opportunities: Continued business expansion through this Project is expected to create additional jobs, both directly and indirectly, in the sourcing, processing, supply chain, and distribution. The Company has over 300 staff members involved in its direct operations, in addition to over 1,100 througha broader network of 90 franchisee partners, and it is scaling both members rapidly. It intends to keep growing its business to distribute its products through more than 400 franchisee stores and 800 home eye checkup teams by FY21, creating employment for over 2,000 people.-Skill development and manpower training: Lenskart plays a significant role in skill development in three major areas (i) training people to operate complex machinery that Lenskart procures to manufacture lenses (ii) training a growing number of vision technicians and optometrists for home eye care examinations and (iii) helping their franchisees recruit and train staff needed for their operations.The Company has worked in collaboration with Skill Tree, an authorized skill development partner appointed by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), to develop a Refraction Training Program to help train optometrists. Skill Tree identifies individuals who are then trained through a six month program run in collaboration with Lenskart. People graduating from this program are assessed, certified and given employment through the Company''s ecosystem of franchise and home eye checkup partners.-Promoting Diversity: Of the 1100+ staff currently employed by the Company and its franchise partners, over 15% are women. Nearly 2% of the employees in their manufacturing operations are specially-abled. The Company trains and improves their skill set, and builds a career path for them by offering senior staff supervisory roles and a chance to grow as professionals.-Better quality and lower prices: The Company will provide quality products at affordable prices. Currently, the market is fragmented and small stores use manual or semi-automatic machines, leading to errors in the eyeglasses which are finally given to customers. The Company largely uses fully-automated machines which are much more accurate and economical."

Third party cane growers and land owners: because Biosev leases a significant amount of land from which its sugarcane is planted, its operations are a source of revenue and access to market for the owners and producers of about 538,000 ha of land from which sugarcane is sourced. About 37 percent of Biosev''s sugarcane is procured from 1,300 independent sugarcane farmers, the remainder is produced on approximately 340,000 ha of land leased from local land owners.iii.	Energy security from a renewable source: Biosev will increase the production of electricity generation from biomass which reduces GHG emissions. The electricity supply in Brazil is largely based on hydropower which, although positive from a climate change perspective, requires alternative complementary energy generation sources due to its seasonality. Sugarcane bagasse is available for co-generation when the hydro dams are at their lowest levels during the year and is a renewable energy complement for ensuring energy security in Brazil. Ethanol produced from sugarcane is currently the most competitive renewable fuel, and is largely used in Brazil as a gasoline substitute.iv.

Add energy generation capacity on the short term when Pakistan is facing severe power shortfalls: The Project is expected to generate 154GWh of energy (P50 case) providing additional power supply to approximately 186,000 customers annually and help address the significant supply deficit which generates regular blackouts in Pakistan. In addition, the Project is undertaken under the Upfront Tariff that has been determined in April 2014 and under which 580 MW of wind power projects have to achieve financial close by March 2015. IFC''s investment in the Project supports a newly issued tariff with the aim of bringing into operation 580 MW by the end of 2016. 2.	Support the development of Pakistan''s renewable energy sector: The Project will promote the use of renewable energy sources for power generation in Pakistan. As of today, wind power represents less than 1% of total generation capacity.3.	Contribute to the diversification of Pakistan existing generation mix: Pakistan current energy mix is highly skewed towards thermal and fossil fuel based power generation sources (65% of the thermal sources consist of furnace oil and natural gas). The rapid depletion of indigenous gas resources and stalled development of large scale hydro or coal based generation capacity, have contributed to increase reliance on highly expensive imported oil which represents 37% of Pakistan generation mix as of today. The Project is not among the lowest sources of energy but as long as supply will lag behind demand, wind tariff will always be more competitive than highly expensive fuel oil based generation; ii) over the long run, as debt is being repaid, the tariff is one of the lowest cost generation sources of power in Pakistan; iii) from a portfolio perspective, wind power ensures long term stability of prices (no volatility related to fuel) and energy security of the country (no exposure to foreign exchange), both positive externalities that are not captured in the wind tariff but contribute to the top energy priorities set by the government of Pakistan.4.	Contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions: The project is expected to generate carbon emission reduction (CERs) through the clean development mechanism of the Kyoto protocol: 68,065 (tCo2) per year is the expected GHG reduction. 5.	Support a local investor in the power sector: The Project emphasizes a strategic partnership and helps develop local expertise to aid future development of renewable energy in Pakistan. This is the second renewable project developed by the sponsors.6.	Strong Impact on Private Sector Development and Economic Growth: Increasing access to power supply in Pakistan is critical to economic growth (estimated production losses of around 2-3% of GDP) by enabling power supply to the industrial sector and alleviating the pressure on government for subsidies and tariffs, which has been a driver for local currency depreciation."

To reach this target, IFC is encouraging innovative approaches with a focus on sectors and markets with the potential to deliver significant climate mitigation impact and scale.  E-Waste is the fastest growing waste stream in the world and currently accounts for 2-5% of total solid waste; however, it accounts for 70% of toxic waste.  An estimated 40 million tons of e-waste is produced every year, growing at the rate of 40% every year. A United Nations report projects that by 2020, e-waste from computers would dramatically increase by 400% from 2007 levels in China and by 500% in India. - Opportunities: The estimated market value of E-Waste management was $11.8 billion last year and is expected to grow to $44.3 billion by 2020.  In addition to the positive environmental impact in proper E-Waste management, proper collection and recycling of e-waste to extract metals makes economic sense as natural resources are scarce, finite, and costly to extract. AHS provides a transparent and trusted platform to collect and distribute the e-waste and this platform is expected to help double the rate of e-waste recycling in 2-3 years."

The quality of service is generally poor and lack of electricity has put a constraint on the country''s economic growth. There is about 6 GW of existing capacity in Nigeria, of which only about 4.5 GW is operating. The Federal Government of Nigeria''s ambitious sector reforms have recently met some major milestones, amongst which the privatization of 6 Generation Assets (GENCOs) and 10 Distribution Assets (DISCOs), the Transmission Company of Nigeria''s management that has been given to Manitoba Hydro International and the Gas Aggregator that has been created and is operating. Overall, it is estimated that generation capacity will increase to 15 GW in 2020 (mainly thermal). If supplied, gas consumption by the power sector could reach 1.9 Bcf/d in 2015 and 2.6 Bcf/d by 2020. Gas production and transportation is critical to the energy mix, and Nigeria harbors significant gas reserves. Seven Energy''s midstream capacity will be sufficient to supply gas for up to 2,15 GW of power capacity, which represents more than a third of the country''s current capacity. In addition to supplying gas to the Ibom Power Plant (IPP), the Company will directly supply the Calabar National Integrated Power Project (NIPP), a plant with a capacity of about 560 MW. Moreover, IFC funding would also contribute to a planned 2014 project between Seven and an IOC to eliminate approximately 23mmcfd of IOC flared gas. The project will divert the gas to Sevens Uquo gas facility where it will be stripped of liquids and the residual gas blended with Sevens gas, adding to Seven''s gas and liquids steams, in addition to eliminating the flared gas.

"2073","VMLA - Mexico",33958,2013-11-20 05:00:00,"Latin America and the Caribbean","1) Innovation/Demonstration Effect: MVNOs are relatively new in LAC. The business model provides tangible benefits to all participants (i.e., MVNOs, Mobile Network Operators (""MNO""), regulators, and most importantly, the consumer). The MVNO model allows for a deeper penetration of services (i.e., including mobile broadband, etc.) as poorly attended client niches (i.e. youth) obtain a well targeted service offering more aligned to its needs and expectations.2) Broadband / Productivity enhancement: VMM offers a data centric service offering. Broadband directly contributes towards improving productivity. The contributions of broadband connectivity to economic growth, and as a kick-starter of other innovative business models (e-health, e-education, e-commerce, etc.), is widely accepted.3) Infrastructure Sharing: This is a key theme in IFC''s TMT sector strategy. As such, MVNOs operate over existing telecoms infrastructure, thus maximizing efficiency, while increasing competition and reducing prices. The owner of the core infrastructure (i.e., MNOs) also benefits as it revenues increases by selling additional minutes and data wholesale. This is particularly relevant for an operator such as Movistar, whose network in Mexico is not fully utilized.  Also, MVNOs have no substantial infrastructure or facilities, so they are unlikely to create E&S risk.4) Availability, affordability & inclusion of underserved markets: MVNOs contribute to expanding the reach of underserved population segments, lowering the cost and increasing competition in mobile telephony.  This is critical in Mexico, which has one of the least developed telecoms sectors in LAC as a result of a dominant player inhibiting competition and keeping prices very high by regional standards.  MVNOs are fully aligned with the regulator''s objective, particularly after the recently enacted telecoms law (June 2013) which has as main objective to reduce America Movil''s (Telcel) grip on this market.  5) Youth: VMM directly targets the youth segment. Youth in general have a lower purchasing power than other population segments, and thus, a targeted and relevant service offer contributes directly to attending this segment''s needs."

Massive blackouts in India have hampered its growth, which is at a decade-low.  From a national security point of view, India plants to double the proportion of gas in its energy mix by 2020 from the current 10% share (coal accounts for 56% of India''s primary energy need and oil 26%), but in the context of declining gas production from domestic fields, meeting this target will prove challenging.  Hoping to boost its natural gas supply and help fix the country''s chronic power shortages, India recently doubled the gas prices from April 2014 onward to around $8.40/mmbtu.  In Bangladesh, gas shortage stands around 500-600 mmcfpd, which results in 600 - 1200 MW of load-shedding, a situation which deteriorates during irrigation seasons, when the demand-supply gap reaches up to 1500 MW. In addition, with 6% of the entire population having access to natural gas and 49% connected to the power grid, most Bangladeshi households in rural areas (99%) as well as urban areas (66%) use biomass for cooking, and the inefficient and poorly ventilated clay stoves have caused 46,000 women and children die each year as a direct result of exposure to indoor air pollution, while many more suffer from respiratory diseases.

Currently, the high cost and delays for international payments create barriers for the small exporters and traders. Earthport will provide them a payment solution which is much faster and at lower cost. (iii)	Financial Inclusion: Because banks do not have efficient systems to transfer small transfers, currently the vast majority of migrant remittances is sent and paid in cash through specialized money transfer operators. Since these operators potentially compete with banks, they have no incentive to encourage senders and recipients to open bank accounts. Earthport''s system for the first time creates a solution that banks can use to effectively offer migrants a competitive money transfer service and compete with the cash-based money transfer companies. Migrants and their families gain a lower cost service and are incentivized to open bank accounts. The solution will also make it commercially feasible or more attractive for the banks to serve low income consumers. Earthport thereby provides a tool to implement the financial inclusion program of banks and governments.  (iv)	Supporting banks in developing countries: The conversion of cash-based remittances into account transfers will increase the deposit base of financial institutions in the receiving developing countries. This makes money available for lending to SMEs, creates hard currency income of the banks to support trade credit, and directs savings and other deposits into bank accounts.

Natural disasters such as windstorm/cyclones, floods and earthquakes constantly represent a threat to poor households and small enterprises. It is currently estimated that the current penetration of microinsurance is close to 2% of the potential market worldwide and that up to 4 billion people at the ''bottom of the pyramid'' could potentially benefit from microinsurance to mitigate their vulnerabilty against risks and disasters. Insurance can prevent people from lossing the achievements of their whole life and from falling back into abhorent poverty.The Project is expected to increase the availability of micro-insurance products to low-income people in Sub Saharan Africa and Emerging Asia, markets that have very low insurance penetration rates. Based on conservative projections, MicroEnsure (ME) expects an increase of more than 7 million low-income people accessing micro-insurance in the next 5 years, however there is a potential for this outreach to be much higher. ME is actively engaged in the provision and development of weather index insurance, a new and innovative product, currently in several countries and reaching tens of thousands of low-income farmers. As ME continues to develop the technology and management of this product, it has the potential to be rolled out on a mass scale.IFC expects the project to have a strong demonstration effect in the micro-insurance space by establishing the viability and profitability of a micro-insurance platform that can successfully deliver tailored products and utilize innovative distribution channels to reach the low income segment."

Through this innovative business model the whole mobile ecosystem benefits (i.e., MVNOs, MNOs, technology providers, and most importantly, the consumer). The MVNO model allows for a deeper penetration of services (i.e., including mobile broadband, etc.) as poorly attended client niches (i.e. youth in the case of Virgin) obtain a well targeted service offering more aligned to its needs and expectations.2) Broadband / Productivity enhancement: VMLA offers a data centric service offering. Broadband directly contributes towards improving productivity. The contributions of broadband connectivity to economic growth, and as a kick-starter of other innovative business models (e-health, e-education, e-commerce, etc.), is widely accepted. 3) Infrastructure Sharing: Infrastructure sharing (i.e., including towers) is a key theme in IFC''s TMT sector strategy. The concept behind MVNOs is the sharing of existing telecoms infrastructure, thus maximizing efficency, increasing competition and reducing prices. The owner of the core infrastructure (i.e., MNOs) also benefits as it revenues increases by selling additional minutes and data wholesale. Moreover, the fact of leveraging on existing infrastructure makes this investment a ""climate friendly"" project. MVNOs have no substantial infrastructure or facilities, so they are unlikely to create E&S risk. 4) Availability, Affordability & inclusion of underserved markets: MVNO contributes to expending the reach of underserved population segments, lowering the cost and increasing competition in mobile telephony.5) Youth: VMLA directly targets the youth segment. Youth in general have a lower purchasing power than other population segments, and thus, a targeted and relevant service offer contributes directly to attending this segment''s needs."

Cost effective transport of imported goods is therefore critical to Iraq''s economy. The 2012 Doing Business indicators however show that Iraq''s is lagging behind other countries in the region in terms of logistics performance. Gulftainer''s investments to modernize one of Umm Qasr berth combined with its experience to efficiently manage container terminals is expected to improve the situation.At present, a substantial portion of goods coming into Iraq are off-loaded at ports in the neighboring countries such as Kuwait, Turkey and Jordan and are then transported into the country by road, which tends to increase the time and cost of delivering the goods to the end consumer.

1.	  Increased supply of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas: IFC expects that Medanito's upstream production will increase from the current level of 3,600 boe/d. About 60% of this upstream production consists of natural gas.  Continued support for gas production and displacement of more carbon-intensive fuels is a key part of the World Bank Group's strategy, as natural gas is endorsed as a bridging fuel in the transition to a low carbon economy. The increased levels of gas production will also mitigate Argentina's dependence on gas imports. 

2. 	Contribution to Government revenues: the project will result in increased sales of natural gas, LPG, and crude oil. The associated provincial taxes, royalties, and federal income taxes will provide an important source of income to the Federal and Provincial Governments (incremental fiscal revenues are estimated at more than US$150 million over the next decade). 

3.  Creation/preservation of local employment and sourcing in Argentina: by extending the life of the Company's reserves, the project will help to secure direct and indirect jobs in the Provinces of Neuquen and Rio Negro.

It is expected that benefits from the project will accrue to different levels of government in Argentina in the form of taxes and royalties. Benefits to the local population are also anticipated in the form of direct and indirect employment. In coming to a view on whether to support this project, IFC has reviewed a range of governance and transparency metrics including, but not limited to, The World Bank Institute's Governance Indicators and Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. The Government has committed to strengthening public sector performance within Argentina's federal system, with a view towards improving the effectiveness of basic service delivery and building transparency and trust, objectives that are supported by the World Bank Group. In addition, the Governments of Neuquen, La Pampa, and Rio Negro adhere to the 2004 ""Ley de Reponsabilidad Fiscal"", meant to promote fiscal discipline at the provincial level. Separately, IFC requires all its extractive industry clients to publicly disclose taxes, royalties and other payments made to governments.  On balance, given the governance situation in the country and the project's expected development benefits, IFC believes that this is a project which it should support."

The Project will rehabilitate the crop land that has not been cultivated for 15-20 year and create jobs in the rural area with high level of unemployment. As pork production remains highly supported by the Government (interest subsidized loans, tax benefits, import tariffs), additional domestic production will also result in losses for the Government and local tax payers, which is expected to be compensated by increased corporate tax payment, benefits to employees, local economy and communities. Overall, the medium to long term developmental impact can be expected as: (i) Russia has excellent long term fundamentals for pig production (feed availability, climate, large tracts of land for waste disposal); (ii) current production costs in the country are not globally competitive but can be improved with better technology and livestock management standards introduced by efficient producers; and (iii) the country is a net importer and may be able to compete on an import parity basis."

The Project will also carry significant benefits for Soufflets partners. In particular, employment and number of farmers reached are expected to grow. Most farms in the region are fairly large and provide substantial employment in rural areas. In addition, Soufflets activities also support many MSMEs (e.g. independent elevators, importers of inputs, transportation companies, security, catering, cleaning, maintenance, etc), which further reinforces the Companys direct impact on the local economy.- Upgrading of storage/logistics infrastructure. Soufflet has acquired and developed 210,000mt of grain storage capacity in the five countries. These facilities were usually poorly maintained, inefficient because of bottlenecks at various stages of loading and unloading, and were not operated at standards of safety applied to the Companys facilities in other countries. The Company has engaged into a multiyear improvement program that frees usable capacity, eliminates bottlenecks and upgrades the standards of operation to internationally accepted levels. This will in turn improve the quality of services to local farmers and local residents. This also provides a benchmark for the operation of competing elevators in the region. - Building more competitive markets. Storage and drying capacity in inland elevators remains limited relative to the current production levels, which provides better negotiating power to elevator operators. Soufflets expansion of its presence and higher standards of operation will provide valuable competition in this underserved market. - Agricultural productivity improvements. Soufflet has a staff of agronomists whose primary mission was to ensure adequate agronomic practices for the production of high quality malting barley. As the Company expands its procurement towards other grains and oilseeds, this expertise is being redeployed to ensure that a package of inputs, prefinancing, agronomic advice, storage and marketing services is available to local farmers to improve productivity and strengthen their partnership with Soufflet.- Strengthening rural economic development.

The Tanzanian mining sector contributed about 3.5% of the country's GDP for the 2008/09 fiscal year. Tanzania's Development Vision 2025 aims to increase this contribution to 10% of GDP by 2025. The Williamson expansion, which contemplates the long-term and economic sustainability of a 70-year old mine, will support this government objective by setting an example and potentially attracting further investments into the Tanzanian mining sector. More specifically, the development impact from the Williamson expansion is expected to include:

(i) Employment: Successful implementation of the Williamson expansion will help maintain the aggregate number of direct and indirect jobs and potentially create opportunities for further indirect employment. Williamson is also expected to introduce skills training to facilitate labor mobility and growth.

(ii) Fiscal Contributions: The Williamson mine has been operating at a loss over the past few years. Petra plans to return the Williamson mine to profitability, and anticipates the mine to start generating royalty payments by FY2013 once the expansion is completed and becoming a tax paying entity by FY2016. As per IFC requirements, Williamson has agreed to publicly disclose all material revenue payments made to the Tanzanian government.

(iii) Community Development: Williamson plans to spend about 2% of revenues on community development, starting in 2013. The mine already contributes directly towards community development through the provisioning of social, commercial, industrial, medical and administrative infrastructures. The Mwadui hospital, which is totally funded by Williamson, provides access to health care facilities for the community as well as various HIV and malaria treatment programs. In partnership with the Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Williamson conducts a community outreach program which provides education, care and treatment to HIV/AIDS patients in Mwadui and other neighboring communities.

(iv) Support to Local SMEs: A large proportion of Williamson's procurement is expected to be from Tanzanian suppliers, of which a significant percentage is expected to be from local and regional suppliers. Williamson is committed to supplier development and training, and expects to allocate a portion of its community development expenditure to such initiatives.

Key indicators that are proposed to be used to monitor the development impact of the Williamson project during its life are: (i) aggregate direct and indirect employment, by gender, both at Petra and at Williamson; (ii) total taxes and royalties paid by Williamson to the government; (iii) total expenditures incurred by Williamson on community development activities; and (iv) amount of money spent by Williamson on purchases of local and national goods and services."

A number of domestic groups have entered the sector in recent years, often in conjunction with power distribution.  They are new to the heating sector; achieving the improved technical performance they projected has proven a challenge and most are now also suffering from capital constraints.

Rehabilitation of such infrastructure is a major national and regional trade issue. Gulftainer investments in Umm Qasr Port and Sulaimaniyah airport should help solve this issue and thus contribute to Iraq integration in the regional and global economy.Iraq heavily relies on imports for its consumer goods and for its reconstruction program. Cost effective transport of imported goods is therefore critical to Iraqs economy. World Banks Doing Business indicators however shows that Iraq is facing difficulties in terms of logistics performances. Gulftainers investments to modernize one of Umm Qasr berth combined with its experience to efficiently manage container terminals should contribute to improve the situation.At present, a substantial portion of goods coming into Iraq are off-loaded at ports in the neighboring countries such as Kuwait, Turkey and Jordan and are then transported into the country by road, which tends to increase the time and cost of delivering the goods to the end consumer. The Project will have a significant impact on reducing these impediments to trade in Iraq and foster the countrys reconstruction efforts along with the economic growth and development. Efficient and well-developed transport and logistics infrastructure is an essential component for the expected growth in the countrys Oil & Gas production & export-related activities and the project would play a strong role in facilitating these improvements.In addition to its direct impact on trade, the Project will also contribute towards socio-economic development through the creation of several hundred jobs, reduction in the cost of goods paid by the end consumer (through reduction of costs incurred in the transportation process) as well as substantial royalty payments to the Government of Iraq.Through its involvement in Iraq (Umm Qasr port in particular), Gulftainer will also play a strong role in training and improving the skills of the employees that would be seconded from IMTC, help introduce industry best-practice and contribute its valuable know-how in managing ports and logistics operations, which would help in improving the overall efficiency of the sector."

The Indian market is undersupplied with locally-manufactured, high voltage motors and generators that are state-of-the-art technologically.  The importance of manufacturing this equipment locally derives not only from transportation cost savings but also because this equipment is built-to-order to very detailed specifications, bringing to the client benefits from the ease and accuracy of information exchange with a local manufacturing facility and improved delivery times. 

Infrastructure Development.  
Infrastructure, including power generation is a bottleneck to economic development in India.  WEG will increase its capacity to sell turbines for small-scale, run-of-the-river generation projects that tend to serve areas that are off-grid.  Further, another important segment which requires high voltage motors are the producers of basic infrastructure building blocks: cement and steel  plants.

1. Deepening the NBFI sector
Indonesia financial sector is still heavily dominated by banks, which accounts for 80% of the financial sector assets. Indonesia needs to develop Non-Banking Financial Institution (NBFI) sector, which can efficiently provide financing to consumers and SMEs through its ability to lower operational costs and deal with much smaller customers than banks would like to do. Additionally, NBFI can provide healthy competition to banks which eventually foster the development of financial sector even further. The proposed Project will provide OTO with adequate long-term fix rate financial resources for its growth. IFC support will help OTO develop its own funding sources, build the ability to compete with the banking system on an ongoing basis, and provide efficient, competitive financing to consumers.

2. Increasing access to motorcycle financing for low income households
OTO customers are mostly low income households who do not have bank accounts. IFC financial support to OTO will help OTO expand its portfolio and networks to more frontier provinces, and hence increase access to finance to low income households for acquiring personal transportation which is important to their business needs and mobility.

Environmental benefits will also materialize through upgrades of existing facilities and the production of ultra-low sulfur diesel. 

During construction and operation of the refinery the main benefits include:

(i) Employment: Approximately 10,000 jobs created during construction (at peak) and 700 direct permanent jobs during operations in addition to the other services that are expected to flourish around the Project. 

(ii) Benefits to GOE:  In addition to tax revenues, the GOE will benefit through a carried interest in the Project, a price discount on diesel produced by the Project, savings on logistics for imports, and additional revenues for CORC and other state-owned companies for services rendered to ERC.

(iii) Environmental Upgrades and Benefits: ERC has agreed to implement, at its own cost, a series of environmental upgrades to the existing site, CORC and the storage facilities of the adjoining state-owned PPC. The upgrades are expected to lead to significant improvements to local air and water quality as they will involve soil decontamination, installation of low nitrogen oxide burners and of a tertiary waste water system at CORC.

In addition, with the start of ERC operations, CORC will switch to using natural gas exclusively for internal energy needs, away from high sulfur fuel oil.  This is expected to reduce cumulative sulfur dioxide emissions in the area surrounding ERC significantly.

More broadly, potential environmental benefits of the Project will come from the supply to the GOE of ultra low sulfur diesel, which has significantly lower sulfur content than diesel currently produced in Egypt, at lower cost than alternative imports.  This will therefore give GOE a low cost option to reduce the average sulfur content of locally consumed diesel and thereby the level of sulfur dioxide emissions in Egypt. 

(iv) Community Impacts: Community Development Centers will be established to offer a variety of community services, including employment/skills training, literacy, health and other life skills education programs and healthcare support. ERC is expecting to invest over US$5 million in community investment during the construction period.

(i) Supporting the Government of Mexico in its pledge to aggressively reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by  30% by 2020 and transition to a low carbon economy.  The Project is expected to generate approx. 290 GWh per annum of clean, non-fossil fuel dependent electricity generation that will displace an estimated 156,000 tCO2e per annum, leading to improved air quality and climate change mitigation; 

(ii) Contributing to economic and community development in the Ejidos of La Mata and La Ventosa, one of the poorest areas in the State of Oaxaca and Mexico.  The Project will provide an important monthly income source to the individual ejidatario landowners upon whose land the wind farm and associated transmission interconnection facilities are installed.  In addition, each of the landowners will continue to have access to and use of their land which can continue to be used for agricultural activities.  While construction is now largely complete, the Project created approx. 150 temporary local jobs under an initiative to employ local community members, including women, for unskilled labor positions during the construction phase of the Project.  In addition, EVM utilized selected construction equipment and materials, such as gravel, sourced from the local community for the Project.  Finally, in consultation and coordination with the local community, EVM will also implement and undertake a community development program following the completion of the Project to ensure continued benefits to the Ejido communities;

(iii) The Project will also have an important demonstration effect and send a market signal to global wind power developers that the Mexican wind power market is viable and ready for scale-up.  Despite the fact that the Isthmus of Tehuantepec has a world-class wind resource with average wind speeds in the 8-12 m/s range, Mexico had only 88 MW of fully-commissioned and operational wind projects at the end of 2008; with four additional wind projects (including the EVM project) completing their construction during 2009 and in various phases of final commissioning and interconnection to the Mexican power grid.   The successful completion and project financing of the incremental 67.5 MW of installed capacity of Project the will send an important signal thereby helping to catalyze and accelerate the development of wind power potential in the State of Oaxaca; and

(iv) Cumulative assessment of bird impacts will be a first in the Project geographic area and ongoing monitoring and collection of additional bird data is anticipated to eventually result in development of a standard collision risk model for avian impact assessment for the wind sector in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

The World Bank Group's ('WBG') 2007-2010 Country Partnership Strategy for Chile has been developed to meet the changing needs of a globally integrated middle-income country and assist the country in its efforts to (i) accelerate sustainable growth and (ii) increase equality of opportunity.  While Chile has not been reliant on World Bank financing given its strong financial position in recent years and investment grade status, the Government of Chile ('GoC') values continued World Bank engagement as a knowledge partner.  Within the integrated WBG strategy, IFC continues to focus on areas where it can support the GoC in its development objectives of encouraging growth and competitiveness, with emphasis on projects with strong demonstration effect in sectors identified as high priority by GoC, including, increasingly, energy and gas development.  In the oil and gas sector, IFC aims to provide long term strategic support to companies that seek to attain international standards in their operations, including environmental and social practices, and help the countries of their operation develop domestic natural resources in a sustainable manner. 

Development Impact

The Government of Chile has set up a priority of developing the country's energy resources and the public tender in 2007 of ten blocks was a significant step in this process, as well as in the Government's aim to achieve greater energy security. IFC's investment in this initial exploration stage will help signal to the private sector the importance of development in this region. If the Project progresses successfully to commercial production it is expected to have the following development impacts:

Increased development of domestic sources of energy. If the joint venture is successful in its exploration efforts, the Project will help support the Government's objective to both increase and diversify its domestic energy sources and suppliers. It will help maximize the use of local natural resources, in particular through exploration and potentially development of natural gas, a cleaner source of fuel, and potentially contribute to development of local industries and downstream activities.
Employment and local community development. Outside of Punta Arenas, the capital of the Magallanes and Ant<e1>rtica Chilena region, employment opportunities are rather limited.  If successful, the Project is expected to help sustain and generate additional employment opportunities in the area. The UJV partners are expected to benefit from GeoPark's knowledge of the region's socioeconomic condition, given that the company's Fell block is located in the same region.
Benefits to the government.  The GoC is expected to benefit from fiscal receipts, such as hydrocarbon production share in the form of royalties and corporate taxes, generated by the Project.  The Contracts state that the operator will pay 17% income tax if the funds are re-invested in the Project, and 35% income tax if there is no re-investment or if funds are repatriated abroad.

Local and regional spending.  The Project is expected to contribute to increased local and regional spending as the majority of oilfield services and operational supplies are expected to be procured locally and regionally. 

The following development outcome indicators will be monitored on an ongoing basis during the exploration phase: (i) investment and work commitments; (ii) discovery of hydrocarbons that can be commercially developed."

The Project will also lower the cost of production in the Panamanian and regional grid by displacing more expensive diesel-fired generation

Satisfying the growing regional power demand:  Power demand in Central America is expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of around 4.1% in the coming years, resulting in large new power generation investment needs.  The Project will clearly contribute to reduce the regional power infrastructure investment gap.

Lower dependency on thermal power:  The dependency on thermal generation in the Central American region has increased substantially since the 1990's when most of the installed capacity was renewable (mainly hydro).  Furthermore, a large component of the expected additional capacity to be constructed in the near term in the region is expected to be thermal.  The Project will hence also contribute to reduce the region's growing dependency on thermal power.

In this country, where private sector credit/GDP is at significantly lower levels compared to EU, IFC will contribute to expanding access to term finance and support SMEs' capital investment plans.  The SME sector is an important driver of the Macedonian economy still offering attractive growth opportunities.

As the Republic of Macedonia is a former Yugoslav republic, the Project will signal IFC's confidence in the long-term prospects of the country's banking sector and economy and will help strengthen the country's standing as an investment destination.  In the short-term, IFC's liquidity support will buttress the market's confidence in the Bank's standing and credibility.

The Project is a good example of IFC's strategy to support intra-regional investments by NLB based in Slovenia, a transition country (albeit one that is now an EU member), into other countries in its region. The successful implementation of the Project will help an experienced strong local sponsor to grow further as a regional player, and facilitate transfer of capital and modern banking practices from Slovenia into the lesser developed markets, such as the Republic of Macedonia.

Both in China and other countries, better management of natural resources and decreased pollution will be necessary to alleviate the strains of continued economic and population growth.

Energy management companies are emerging as rapidly increasing critical supporters of energy efficiency technology, particularly in China.  Since 1996, when the World Bank-supported China's Energy Conservation Project, which helped found three pilot EMCs, over 100 EMC companies have emerged. As large industrial companies typically do not have the in-house technological, managerial or financial capacity devoted for the development of energy efficiency technologies, the services provided by EMC companies are recognized as a unique value proposition and viable standalone businesses.  However, EMCs face a host of challenges themselves, and in particular have difficulty obtaining financing due to lack of familiarity with their business model.

The growing gap has been driven by under-investment in the sector on the one hand and sustained economic expansion on the other.  The latter was fuelled by a combination of growth in the industrial sectors, increased use of natural gas in vehicles and further distorted by energy pricing policies.  In this context PAE is one of the few operators in the country continuing to increase its oil and gas production.  Gas represents around 38% of the Companys proven reserves and part of the 2009 investment program will go towards increasing gas production.  In the past 7 years PAE has grown its oil production by 39% while nationwide production (including PAE) has declined by 20%. In the same period, PAE grew its gas production by 84% compared to a 28% increase in nationwide production.  The impact of the Companys investment program in the GSJ region is expected to result in an average annual increase of production of approximately 2.7% p.a. or 14% total over the next four years.  Creation/Preservation of local employment:  PAE is a key employer in the regions where it operates, especially in the GSJ basin where it employs 914 direct staff and almost 6730 contractors. The IFC investment will contribute to the Companys growth, which has lead to an average of 200 new direct jobs created per annum since 2005. In addition, the investment will help maintain the employment level on a company-wide basis in the provinces of Chubut and Santa Cruz, where the oil and gas industry offers significant employment opportunities.  Strong community development and linkages program:  PAE continues to spend increasing amounts on social development programs ranging from education and health programs to Small Medium Enterprise support programs in its areas of operation.  In 2007 and 2008, the Company spent $3.6 million and $5.5 million, respectively, on these programs. Local/National Sourcing:  The Company procures most of its goods and services in Argentina.  In 2008, PAE spent approximately $896 million on Argentine investments, goods and services from national and regional suppliers, and a large portion of the 2009 capital expenditure is expected to be sourced locally/nationally.Contribution to government revenues:  PAE contributes significant fiscal revenues to all levels of government. During 2008, PAE made approximately US$1.3 billion in payments to various levels of government consisting of income taxes, royalties, export tariff and other taxes. The Company submits financial statements on quarterly basis to the Argentinas National Securities Commission as part of its obligation, and such disclosures are available publicly. In addition to remaining a significant contributor of tax revenues for both the federal and regional budgets and is also expected to continue contributing to Argentinas foreign currency earning over the life of the IFC loans.

Natural gas is one of the cleanest and cheapest fossil fuels, and its widespread use is one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing harmful air pollution caused by the widespread use of less clean-burning fuels that can be replaced by natural gas, such as the sulfur-containing fuel oil and coal used by industry. In particular, IZGAZ activities have already contributed greatly to the use of natural gas as a fuel for residential cooking and heating. This has greatly reduced the reliance on lignite, coal, fuelwood and LPG by households, and has led to benefits of convenience and lower household fuel bills, as well as resulting in lower local atmospheric pollution. The continued expansion of IZGAZ distribution activities in the license area will reinforce these benefits in the future."

The extractive industries is specifically targeted as one of the sectors that should be developed to make optimal use of the countrys limited natural resource base to expand export earnings.  The strategy particularly identifies the mining sectors potential to offer a source of long-run, export-led growth.  The World Bank and IFCs country strategy focuses on promoting diversification of the economy and supporting project development in mining, with emphasis on junior miners. Development Impact:IFCs involvement in Burkina Fasos growing mining sector will have an important demonstration effect in terms of setting environmental and social standards. IFC will assist Gryphon to handle social, environmental, community development and mine closure issues in line with IFC Environmental and Social Performance Standards.The direct development impacts during the pure exploration and feasibility study stage are expected to be limited.  Because the investment predates any feasibility study, it is not yet possible to fully quantify or specify the potential development impacts during production stage. However, expected developmental impacts during production phase include:Demonstration Effect: Burkina Faso is an emerging resource-rich country which has attracted a lot of interest from the global mining community.  IFC involvement in the sector could assist in establishing some benchmarks on sustainable resource development.   Important demonstration effects include setting environmental and social standards.  IFC will assist Gryphon to handle social, environmental, community development and mine closure issues in line with IFC Environmental and Social Performance Standards.Economic Diversification and Community Development: The Project would support the Burkinabe governments efforts to diversify the economy from its current dependence on agricultural production. In addition, the project which is located outside the key centers of commercial activity would generate economic activity in what is otherwise an agrarian-based and under-developed part of the country.Revenues to Government: The Project, once operational, is expected to generate revenues in the form of taxes, dividends and royalties to the host Government and the Project would also generate positive foreign currency flows.Creation of Direct and Indirect Employment:The project could also have a high impact on local economies through the generation of employment opportunities for the local population.  The key development indicators that are to be monitored during the life of IFCs investments are:  (i) number of projects that would employ industry best practices on sustainable resource development; (ii) number of non-farm economic activities including community development projects that would develop around the project; (iii) the direct and indirect increase in non-farm jobs that would be created around the project; and (iv) amount of taxes, dividends and royalties paid to government as a result of the project."

"3214","Kuwait Energy Company KSCC",28068,2009-05-19 04:00:00,"Middle East","The project will lead to further exploration, appraisal and development of domestic natural resources in Egypt and Yemen. Both countries have seen significant declines in their oil production in recent times, coupled with a fast increase in domestic demand.  Both governments are highly dependent on oil and gas revenues to maintain macro-economic stability as well as their social welfare programs.In Egypt, oil production has declined from a peak of nearly 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 1997 to around 710,000 bpd in 2007. Given the rapid increase in domestic oil demand, Egypt is expected to become a net oil importer soon.  Oil and gas revenues account for 15% of Egypts Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 46% of Egypts exports. The sector is also the most important source of fiscal revenues for the Government of Egypt (GOE), representing 25% of GOEs budgeted revenues for 2008/9. In Yemen, the poorest country in the MENA region, oil production is declining at an even more rapid rate, with 2008 output averaging just 293,000 bpd, compared to a peak of 457,000 bpd in 2001.  Production decline is expected to accelerate over the next few years if no significant new discoveries are made, with current forecasts predicting Yemen will run out of oil in the next 10 to 12 years. Yemens oil and gas sector accounts for over 90% of the countrys export earnings and an estimated 75% of Government of Yemens (GOY) revenue. The Project is expected to produce significant development impacts:  - Contribution to Government Revenues: The Project benefits to Egypt and Yemen include revenues that accrue to these governments in the form of production share, royalties and corporate taxes.  In 2008, GOEs fiscal take from KECs operations in Egypt was US$58 million and GOYs take was US$19 million. As stated above, both governments are highly dependent on continuing fiscal revenues from the oil and gas sector in order to sustain their respective social programs. The net present value of the total payments to the GOE from 2009 to 2012 is expected to be over US$100 million. Given the exploratory nature of KECs assets in Yemen, future revenues to GOY will depend on the success of the Companys exploration activities in 2009. - Employment and development of local skills: The Project will help sustain employment in both countries. In Egypt, the operating company currently employs approximately 50 full time employees and has 175 contractors. This is expected to rise to nearly 70 personnel and approximately 350 contractors by 2010, of which at least 90% will be Egyptian nationals.  Without this Project and the associated development and exploration programs, these jobs would be largely lost.  In Yemen, due to the early stage of operations, KEC currently has less than 10 people directly employed and approximately 125 contractors. With the start of significant exploration activity this figure is expected to rise to approximately 15 direct employees and an average of 175 contracted staff by 2010. Approximately 70% of direct personnel in Yemen are expected to be Yemeni nationals. - Supporting the development of local independent E&P sector in MENA: Through this financing, IFC will play an important role in supporting the only sizeable private Kuwaiti E&P player and the only major Kuwaiti company run by a woman. The E&P sector in MENA has traditionally been dominated by large state-owned oil companies or Western oil and gas companies. KEC is one of the first significant attempts by the local private sector to participate in this sector. KECs ability to grow into a company on a par with other mid-size international E&P companies is hoped to encourage other such private sector initiatives.The key development indicators to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment include:(1) Payments accruing to governments;(2) Direct employment levels;(3) Local purchase of goods and services (including contractors); and(4) KEC 2P net reserves."

Rural electrification has been a long-time focus of the WB and IFC. Access to reliable electricity is an active catalyst for sustainable development as it can boost living standards, it can prevent rural exodus and emigration to urban areas, it can reduce mortality and improve gender quality.

The Project aims to support the progressive transformation and improvement of living conditions of the population in rural areas of Senegal which at present lack electricity (85% of the population in rural areas in 2005).  This will be achieved by (i) providing lighting and access to modern communications to rural households; (ii) improving delivery of social services with the provision of electricity for potable water systems, health clinics and schools; and (iii) enhancing economic productivity with the use of electricity for productive purposes.

Senegal's population in rural areas depends on fuel-wood for cooking, kerosene lamps and some small flashlights operating with batteries for lighting, and on human force - frequently from women - for domestic and productive tasks.  The Project has the potential of promoting growth and the personal development of women and children by making their domestic workload less heavy. In addition, the social benefits from electrification  the ability to power lights, radios, small appliances and televisions  make a significant contribution to enhancing the quality of life and to the reduction of poverty.

Improve access to electricity: 

The Project will provide electricity to 19,574 rural users in the next three years who at present do not have access to electricity, covering 298 villages.  The proposed Project will provide electricity to 213 schools and 118 health centers, thus allowing rural populations to access better education and health services.

Foster the development of local businesses and improved health services:  

The PREM subsidies will allow the Company to put in place electrical installations to increase the productivity of one SME, the Laiterie du Berger, and to improve the operations and services of 28 health centers as they will be able to preserve vaccines.  The doubling of capacity of the SME will provide extra income of US$60-80/month approximately to each of 400 additional families who will supply electricity to the Laiterie.

Significant improvement to the enabling environment for the creation of a viable housing finance market in West Bank.  Institutional and legal constraints today create major obstacles to mortgage lending.  It is expected that the removal of such obstacles particularly registration of titles, difficulty of foreclosures will encourage lenders to come into the market and scale up their lending programs.

Access to finance for middle and low income individuals.  The project will make affordable, long term home finance available to a significant number of people in the low and middle income brackets.  The homes financed will help improve the living standards of the borrowers as they get access to safe and more spacious housing as compared to the overcrowded and cramped conditions they currently face.  The longer term of the mortgages to be provided under the program will play a major role in making homes more affordable by reducing the monthly payments to a level that could be serviced by a broader segment of the population.

Boost to the construction sector:  Although the program is intended to fund only mortgages and not construction, the creation of effective demand by the financing available under the program will encourage developers to take a more active approach in developing their projects as the risk to them will be reduced by an increase in the number of  potential buyers.  The program may include financing of progress payments for booking of units in multifamily housing developments in the construction phase.

In addition, since Helios Towers is not affiliated with any operator, and as its business model is predicated on sharing and collocation, the benefits of expanded access through Helios Towers will also be available to new market entrants. Collocation reduces the incremental cost of expanding service for all carriers thereby allowing them to service remote and economically less developed areas where ARPU and usage will be lower. Increase competition: The presence of Helios Towers in the Nigerian market will allow smaller and newer wireless operators to benefit from reduced barriers to entry as they will have access to leased tower facilities rather than having to build their own.Expand access to other ICT technologies:  Helios Towers will be building a tower network that is capable of supporting not only mobile cellular networks, but also wireless broadband and backhaul networks, thereby improving the penetration of these technologies.Contribute to mitigating environmental impact and Climate Change: This project will provide a cost effective opportunity to telecommunication operators to reduce their carbon emission footprint by sharing infrastructure. A significant benefit of sharing tower infrastructure arises from the material, energy and emissions savings that ensue from building only one tower instead of three or four.  The most immediate impact is on the visual environment, where the removal of two or three unnecessary towers creates an immediate visual benefit. The savings in resources are more significant, as only one-third or one quarter of the steel, concrete and other building materials are necessary for a shared tower. Finally, in areas of uncertain power supply like Nigeria, the ability to use only one back-up power generator to serve an area where there would formerly be 3 or 4 back-up power generators for separate towers, results in immediate and continuing reduction of harmful emissions."

Within the integrated WBG strategy, IFCs particular development objectives in Albania are to (i) facilitate privatization and promote private sector investments in infrastructure; (ii) promote export competitiveness of the economy through support of local export-oriented companies; (iii) improve investor confidence and help increase foreign investment inflows; and (iv)  promote market liberalization through encouraging fair practices and effective competition. The proposed investment will be closely aligned with this strategy. Development Impact:The Project is expected to generate the following development impacts:Developing domestic energy resourcesAlbania is not a major hydrocarbon producer but has possibly sizeable heavy oil reserves, which if developed with the help of advanced technologies can help increase domestic oil output. The proposed investment will help Bankers accelerate oil recovery from the Patos Marinza field (and possibly at a later stage, the Kucova field), and promote greater private investment and participation in Albanias energy sector. Attracting foreign direct investmentAlbania needs increased foreign direct investment(FDI) to develop its hydrocarbon sector, as well as other sectors of the economy.  The Companys investment in the project would make Bankers one of the countrys largest foreign investors in this sector. IFCs direct involvement will help stimulate the much needed FDI inflows in Albania. Contribution to government revenues  The project will generate substantial revenue flows to the Albanian government. The capital investment program and incremental oil production as a result of the proposed investment will result in direct economic benefits in the form of increased fiscal receipts, through income taxes (50%), royalties to the Government of Albania (10%) and Albpetrol (1-5%). Development of local skill and, technology transferMost of the staff working in the Companys operations are Albanian nationals. The Company directly employed about 200 staff in Albania at the end of 2008.  The Project is expected to contribute to further development of local skills, and transfer of knowledge and technology for heavy oil extraction, both of which will aid in the future development of the Albanian oil industry. Potential contribution to environmental remediation effortsThe Company seeks to conduct its operations in line with good international practices. Its progressive development of the field, as existing Albpetrol operations are taken over, will result in an incremental decrease of pollution and considerable clean-up in working areas, as well as reduction of health and safety risks to the communities as the initial clean-up of contaminated locations will help halt leakage from poorly abandoned equipment and ongoing pre-existing Albpetrol activities. In addition, the Company will also potentially support plans that may be developed by the public sector to undertake wider environmental remediation activities of areas affected by Albpetrols historical operations in the field, in conjunction with Albpetrol and other Albanian government agencies. IFC plans to monitor the following development impacts: (i) payments to the government; (ii) employment created / maintained; and (iii) provision of training to local staff."

Investments in infrastructure projects, such as power, water and transport, have direct impacts on improving quality of life and enabling local economic development.  

In the last 15 years, on average about $10 billion a year has been spent on infrastructure in sub Saharan Africa, of which only about 30% was private sector investment and half of that was in the telecommunications sector. It is widely recognized that in order to achieve a reasonable growth rate Africa should be spending at least $20 billion a year. This additional investment cannot all be funded by the public sector and for this reason emphasis is being placed by the WBG and other donors on developing Public Private Partnerships ('PPPs').  If the development of a larger number of PPPs is successful, very large amounts of additional long term private sector debt will be required.   The project is another of the building blocks necessary to achieve increased involvement of the private sector in the development of infrastructure projects. Higher private sector financing catalyzed will free public sector capital for investment in other priority sectors.  The project also supports the expansion of a highly successful Fund which has already demonstrated its ability to originate and book commitments for projects in Africa, not only alongside existing DFIs in larger projects, but more recently and increasingly on a sole mandate basis with smaller clients.

The development impact of the project is thus captured in terms of the amount of private investment mobilized into productive infrastructure, the expansion of access to infrastructure made available by project investments, and the quality of those investments and the role of the Fund in extending appropriate environmental and social standards."

A successful project of this size would likely spur significant additional global mining interest in Colombia, particularly valuable at a time when Colombia has demonstrated considerable progress in addressing security issues and political risk and is well positioned for continued economic success.IFC has identified Colombia as a primary target for mining investment because of the potential for substantial development impact from the mining sector.  This would be IFCs first mining investment in Colombia.A mine development of the expected size could have substantial impact on the local communities, not only through direct employment and services, but also from government royalties and taxes that flow back directly to local municipalities.  It is estimated that 97% of the royalties will flow back directly to the region, with 87% of total royalties flowing to the municipality level.  The Government of Colombia and oil and gas companies have been working with IFC on a pilot municipal level royalty management and capacity building program in the petroleum sector.  The Government of Colombia, the Ministry of Mines, and mining associations have expressed interest in expanding this program to the mining sector.  The two municipalities where the project is located could be part of any second pilot program, further ensuring greater development benefits to the local communities. IFCs proposed investment will fund the completion of a BFS and ESIA, which will be used as the basis by which a decision for mine development will be made.

The goal of increasing economic growth rests primarily on the expansion of the private sector, its competitiveness and its diversification.  To support this economic growth objective, IFCs strategy in Ghana has focused on supporting private provision of infrastructure, deepening the domestic financial sector, expanding opportunities for micro, small and medium scale enterprise borrowing through local financial institutions, promoting the development of non-traditional exports and enhancing the business environment.IFCs support of the project is consistent with this strategy:  It promotes the development of a private sector-led industry that can generate exports and/or replace expensive imports of crude by local refineries and opens up avenues for additional downstream investments by using gas that can provide energy to sustain economic growth.  It will provide Government with the resources needed to pursue its poverty reduction strategy.Development Impact:The development of the Jubilee oil field is expected to generate substantial benefits for the country:-  Develop domestic sources of energy:  The project would help develop local sources of energy which opens up options for the Government to address critical issues such as dependence on foreign crude imports and foreign exchange generation.  The project also raises the possibility of gas production, which can provide substantial opportunities at addressing the shortage of power in the country.-  Expand exports/reduce imports:  The project would help add to Ghanas exports and generate substantial foreign exchange earnings through export of crude.  Alternatively, local oil production will allow Ghana to replace crude oil imports, thereby conserving foreign exchange for the country. -  Attract foreign direct investment:  Although oil exploration has been taking place in Ghana since its independence in 1957, few oil companies have shown interest in the country.  The size of the Jubilee field and its successful development should spur significant interest from major oil companies and energize Ghanas hydrocarbon sector by increasing exploration and development activities in the country.  This interest should result in expanding foreign direct investment in Ghana, which has remained relatively low for an economy of its potential.-  Generate revenues for Government:  It is expected that the Government of Ghana will receive substantial fiscal receipts from royalties, production sharing and corporate taxes, generated by oil production from the project.-  Create direct employment:  Production operations and onshore support will bring employment opportunities.  Approximately 156 employment opportunities with between 10% to 50% local staffing content are expected.  In addition, marine and aviation support operations will continue to provide approximately 60 employment opportunities with a local staff complement of between 30% and 80%.

Ghana's poverty reduction strategy seeks to (i) raise private sector competitiveness; (ii) improve human development outcomes with interventions in health, education, water and sanitation, and social protection sectors; and (iii) strengthen governance through decentralization, public sector reform, and promotion of results-based public policy choice.

To help with its strategy, the World Bank Group's program in Ghana has set three overarching objectives:  increasing economic growth, reducing poverty and reducing inequalities.  The goal of increasing economic growth rests primarily on the expansion of the private sector, its competitiveness and its diversification.  To support this economic growth objective, IFC's strategy in Ghana has focused on supporting private provision of infrastructure, deepening the domestic financial sector, expanding opportunities for micro, small and medium scale enterprise borrowing through local financial institutions, promoting the development of non-traditional exports and enhancing the business environment.

IFC's support of the project is consistent with this strategy:  It promotes the development of a private sector-led industry that can generate exports and/or replace expensive imports of crude by local refineries and opens up avenues for additional downstream investments by using gas that can provide energy to sustain economic growth.  It will provide Government with the resources needed to pursue its poverty reduction strategy.

Development Impact:
The development of the Jubilee oil field is expected to generate substantial benefits for the country:

-  Develop domestic sources of energy:  The project would help develop local sources of energy which opens up options for the Government to address critical issues such as dependence on foreign crude imports and foreign exchange generation.  The project also raises the possibility of gas production, which can provide substantial opportunities at addressing the shortage of power in the country.

-  Expand exports/reduce imports:  The project would help add to Ghana's exports and generate substantial foreign exchange earnings through export of crude.  Alternatively, local oil production will allow Ghana to replace crude oil imports, thereby conserving foreign exchange for the country. 

-  Attract foreign direct investment:  Although oil exploration has been taking place in Ghana since its independence in 1957, few oil companies have shown interest in the country.  The size of the Jubilee field and its successful development should spur significant interest from major oil companies and energize Ghana's hydrocarbon sector by increasing exploration and development activities in the country.  This interest should result in expanding foreign direct investment in Ghana, which has remained relatively low for an economy of its potential.

-  Generate revenues for Government:  It is expected that the Government of Ghana will receive substantial fiscal receipts from royalties, production sharing and corporate taxes, generated by oil production from the project.

-  Create direct employment:  Production operations and onshore support will bring employment opportunities.  Approximately 156 employment opportunities with between 10% to 50% local staffing content are expected.  In addition, marine and aviation support operations will continue to provide approximately 60 employment opportunities with a local staff complement of between 30% and 80%.  Such employment would also bring a new set of skills and technology into the country and would expand the employment opportunities of local participants both regionally and globally. 

-  Stimulate demand for local goods and services:  Under the Petroleum Agreement signed with the Government, Kosmos and its partners shall give preference to materials, services and products produced in Ghana.  The focus on locally produced goods and services will encourage economic activity in other areas such as construction, rentals, fabrication and business services.

The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are:
- annual oil production;
- direct employment levels;
- production sharing and fiscal payments accruing to the Governments; and
- annual expenditures on domestic goods and services."

The project promotes the convergence of different services under one package, thus improving connectivity and reducing gaps in access by:

- Extending coverage of basic telecommunication services: WIND expects to eventually deploy a quasi-nationwide network. Its wireless technology contributes to more efficient, cheaper and wider coverage, which includes un-served and underserved areas of the Dominican Republic.

- Reducing pricing: A new entrant like WIND would be promoting competition against the incumbent telcos and pay TV providers. The synergies provided by a triple play offering, and by the development of a mostly wireless network, should support a case for lower overall pricing.

- Increasing service offerings: WIND provides an ample array of services, including connectivity (voice and data) and video for individual users as well as corporate data products such as co-hosting and co-location.

- Distributing relevant content: Unlike with other wireless video platforms (i.e., DTH), WIND offers a new distribution channel for local programming.

Formalizing provision of TV services:
The entrance of new players like WIND, with digital networks, has allowed regulator Indotel to formalize the TV sector, where piracy was rampant.


Reduce intra-country digital divide:
Even though mobile voice and fixed data density has been on the rise nationally, rural and suburban areas are far behind. WIND has a scalable nationwide deployment strategy, thus taking digital services to poorer areas of the country. Lack of basic services at affordable rates is a critical problem for micro-business owners, impeding economic development. WIND's state-of-the-art technology allows for technology transfer to and within the Dominican Republic.

Broadband connectivity:
Broadband services are critical for improving the operational efficiency of Government and large and small enterprises. At the retail level, fast internet access contributes to improving communications, exchange of information and entertainment. The Dominican Republic currently lags its peer countries in Broadband penetration rates, the Project will support an increase in this penetration levels by making the service more widely available and accessible.

Employment: 
WIND currently employs over 170 people. By 2012 it expects over 300 direct employees, not counting indirect employment (independent distributors).

Focus on educational corridors: 
WIND's initial backhaul roll-out focused strongly in connecting the major universities in the Dominican Republic. 

Free educational channels:
The company, together with the Government, launched a plan to provide free TV access to 8 international educational channels (from HBO and Discovery) for 300 public schools, with the idea of extending such program to 3,000 public schools in the next two years as the network footprint increases."

This holds true particularly for China, where growth is fueled by efficient deployment of information technology. Datacenter operations are critical to ensure the security and stability of IT services for all businesses. This is becoming an increasingly necessary component of IT solutions in China as businesses (particularly in the Financial Services Industry) deal with increasingly sensitive and critical information; and firms in China finalize the centralization of their IT production systems, thus making IT services particularly vulnerable to business interruption stemming from threats of any nature, from power outages to natural disasters.An investment in this nascent and underinvested industry will greatly support the companys ability to develop and grow in the domestic datacenter sector, specifically in secondary areas.  While much emphasis has been put into developing sophisticated IT solutions for companies in China, only recently (especially after the devastating earthquake in Sichuan) has the importance of data security, backup, and consolidation been stressed in the business community.  The project will have significant developmental impact by:- bringing higher standards of datacenter infrastructure and service to local, national, and even international companies, thus facilitating the implementation of efficient IT solutions and best practices,- supporting a new and independent Chinese company in rolling out operations in frontier regions in China, including Sichuan, Shaanxi and Liaoning, thereby providing quality, cost effective, and secure datacenter facilities for local businesses whose operations may be vastly improved,- demonstrating to other domestic players as it is the first company to provide quality services and infrastructure that are compliant with international standards, and- providing world-class infrastructure and connectivity to specific geographic areas to enable companies that need IT services to operate, especially given that IT infrastructure penetration is not uniform in developing countries such as China."
"3320","Salamander UJV",27318,2008-11-20 05:00:00,"East Asia and the Pacific","Fit With World Bank Group Strategy:The most recent World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy for Laos (FY07-11WBG CAS) has four major aims: - private sector development and finance; - sustainable natural resource development; - public financial management; and - poverty reduction.  Thailands National Development Agenda, which forms the framework for a partnership between Thailand and the World Bank, is built around four pillars, including Natural Resources and Environment.  The Bank has also been supporting Thailands emerging role as a development assistance donor and an advocate for strengthening regional cooperation. The Bank also supports the Lao-Thai Partnership in Sustainable Hydropower Development to ensure that future hydropower projects in Laos will be friendlier to the environment and the people affected by them. It also works with the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy Business Council to promote investments and strengthen private sector cooperation within the Greater Mekong Sub-region.Within this overall framework, IFCs strategic priorities in the region are to: - increase impact in IDA countries; - lead efforts to address climate change; and - reach the underserved in frontier regions.  In the oil and gas sector, IFCs focus is to pursue more early equity investments (for which capital from other sources is more limited) and to be a long-term partner for companies that seek to attain international standards in their operations, including environmental and social practices, while supporting countries in the sustainable development of their domestic sources of energy, especially natural gas (a clean source of fuel). This investment is consistent with both the World Bank and IFC strategies, since it supports a junior oil and gas company operating in an IDA country (Laos) and a frontier region (Northeast Thailand) and in a project focusing on development of natural gas resources. Development Impact:Should the project progress successfully to commercial production, it is expected to generate the following development impacts: Pilot Development Of The Upstream Sector In Laos:  Salamanders activity represents the first investment in upstream oil and gas in Laos since 1998.  If the Company is successful in its exploration efforts, the Project would help demonstrate the viability of investment by small independents in the Lao upstream sector and help catalyze the development of an upstream industry in the country.  Supporting Further Regional Cooperation Between Laos And Thailand Through Potential Export Of Gas/Electricity To Thailand And Cooperation In Other Infrastructure Development In The Bordering Area: Thailand is expected to be, at least initially, the principal market for Laotian gas.  Discovery of gas may lead to development of gas-fired electricity generation in Laos, with any excess electricity exported to Thailand.  This will help further development of the infrastructure in the region which already exists for the export of hydro power from Laos to Thailand and the import of gas-fired generated electricity from Thailand to Laos during the dry season.Increased Supply Of Domestic Sources Of Energy, Import Substitution, Promoting The Development And Use Of Natural Gas As A Cleaner Fuel:  The Project will increase the supply of domestic sources of energy in Laos and Thailand, helping reduce their need to use limited foreign currency reserves for expensive energy imports.  The investment will support the exploration for and development of natural gas reserves, a cleaner source of fuel.Supporting Local Economic Development Through Payments To The Government:  The governments of Laos and Thailand will receive fiscal receipts from hydrocarbon production taxes, bonuses and corporate taxes generated by the investment.  Under the Savannakhet PSC, the Government takes 45% of oil or 37% of gas as its share of profit petroleum and an income tax of 30% on taxable profits in addition to various production bonuses, rentals, training and government assistance payment. Under the Thai concessions, the Government takes a royalty of 5-15% of gross revenue and an income tax of 50% on taxable profits.  Approximately 15% of royalties in Thailand are expected to ultimately accrue to the regions where the oil and gas activities are undertaken.Creating Some Job Opportunities And Providing Training In Local Communities: The Project will generate some job opportunities in Laos and Northeast Thailand, where agriculture is the primary business and few other job opportunities are available. In addition, the Company will also contribute to training of local staff and development of a domestic labor force with knowledge of the oil and gas industry.IFC plans to monitor the following development impacts: - gas sales;- payments to governments; and- employment."

As such, the expected development impacts from the project are substantial and diverse, and may include:(i) Generation of Direct and Indirect Employment: The Project is expected to create approximately 12,000 direct jobs (refinery and port sites) for local Guineans during construction and approximately 2,000 direct jobs (refinery and port sites) during the operations phase. Additionally, the creation of three to five secondary and tertiary jobs for each wage-paying job is anticipated. The project company is currently implementing some vocational and health/safety training to maximizing the sourcing of local skilled labor. The Bok<e9> Technical Training School will produce job-ready workers for the Project construction phase. The school is partly funded by the Governments Education Department which provides some training budget, power, equipment and materials. The project company has planned significant investment in providing additional resources and improving the facilities. About 1,000 Guineans attend classes in trade skill development.(ii) Fiscal Contributions: The project is expected to generate between $5-12.5 million per year in lump sum taxes to the Guinean government for the first 15 years of its operations. Beginning in the 16th year, tax on profits of 35% will be paid to the Government, averaging $418 million per year In addition, there will be a mining royalty tax averaging $22 million per year based on bauxite consumption. In total, the project is estimated to generate $8.2 billion of new tax revenue through 2044. The project company has agreed to publicly disclose all revenue payments made to the Government over the life of the project.  (iii) Community Development: The company has committed $2.5 million per year during construction. During operations, a compulsory contribution of $0.5 million per annum (for years 1 through 15) and $1.0 million per annum (from year 16 thereafter) is required.  In addition to this, the company has proposed a voluntary contribution of $3.5 million per annum for the duration of operations to fund community development programs, in the region and at the national level. The project company has also entered into a partnership with the African Development Foundation to implement a program for a school and health center in the main relocated village. Training initiatives for the community include training for village elementary school teachers, adult French literacy programs, environmental management, health and hygiene, understanding of national law, HIV/AIDS awareness and malaria prevention knowledge. In addition, the project company is planning to establish a community development foundation at the commencement of production, similar to the Mozal Community Development Trust in Mozambique. (iv) Support to Local SMEs:  Procurement of an estimated $150 million worth of goods and services in Guinea is expected during Project construction. Once built, an estimated $40 million worth of procurement is expected annually from within Guinea for continuing operations. (v) Public Infrastructure: The project is currently developing infrastructure projects that will benefit the broader population, including road and bridge upgrades from Kamsar port to the Sangar<e9>di refinery site, construction of the container terminal at Kamsar and improvements in the Government owned railway operations. In addition, the project is expected to lead to improvements in the social infrastructure in Boke and Sangar<e9>di where housing will be built and employees will be supported to own their own homes.Key indicators that are proposed to be used to monitor the development impact of the project during its life are: (i) taxes and royalties paid to the Government; (ii) direct and indirect jobs created during the construction and operational phases; (iii) number of employees having received vocational training by the project company; (iv) number and total value of contracting arrangements with domestic businesses; and (v) total expenditures incurred by the project company on community development activities.

"3368","Waterhealth India Private Limited",27215,2008-07-30 04:00:00,"South Asia","IFC's involvement in the project is expected to have a development impact in terms of: 

- Access to affordable and potable drinking water: 

The lack of 24/7 safe drinking water has significant adverse impacts on the quality of life and health conditions of people. This Project will allow WIPL to replicate its success in providing reliable and quality water to people in rural areas increasing their health and overall longevity of life. Access to clean water would also help in significantly reducing the high number of water borne disease cases in the country. The systems installed through the current project are expected to be able to serve the potable water need of about five million people. 

- Strong Environmental benefits:

The adoption of WHI's systems also yields important environmental benefits. Firstly, in addition to its high energy efficiency, avoidance of the use of chemicals with potential toxic by-products, and minimal wastage of input water, one WHC-65 unit would displace the equivalent of 500 metric tons of carbon emissions that would have been created by boiling water with firewood. Secondly, as a high level of commercial and physical losses in the water sector make it commercially infeasible; the current Project assists in minimizing water losses by supplying water at the retail level thereby avoiding supply leakage losses. These benefits are expected to make the company eligible for credits under the CDM route.

- Contribution to employment opportunities 

Each WHC-65 employs two service operators, maintenance engineers and other requisite personnel. The company engages people from the village for these services and trains them to operate machines and perform the revenue collection function. As WIPL expands to more villages, it would provide employment, training and capacity building for locals in that area."

Increasing the supply of legally harvested wood will also encourage development of Nicaraguas downstream capacity in the furniture and other wood processing industries. In addition, the project could serve as a model for private and public involvement in sustainable development of the hurricane affected lands.  Job Creation:The project will create 400 additional permanent jobs. Most of the employment opportunities are expected to be in RAAN, where the unemployment rate is higher than in the rest of the country. The project will also continue to support indirect employment through outsourcing of the companys trucking and furniture manufacturing to independent small businesses that employ an aggregate of 100 people.  Positive Impact on Climate Change:The project will have a significant impact on global climate change.  Processing the downed trees into lumber will achieve the carbon sequestration for the life of the manufactured products, as opposed to leaving the trees on the ground to decompose and emit greenhouse gases, such as methane and CO2.  Reforestation will also contribute to carbon sequestration and maintaining healthy tropical ecosystems.The project will help prevent deforestation of the hurricane affected area by establishing plantations and setting aside areas for natural forest re-growth, rather than being converted into agricultural use or cattle farming lands.  The positive impact of the Project on the environment could be further increased if a future investment in a cogeneration power plant proves feasible.Community Engagement:The project will have a significant beneficial impact on local RAAN communities as it is the companys practice to allow the local community to benefit from company infrastructure, such as access roads, and provisions such as food, fuel, etc which are made available to them at cost.  The sponsor has already demonstrated their interest in working with indigenous communities through their work with the Layasiksa, a local community.

The proposed project will contribute to Egypt's effort in transitioning from a supplier of raw material to an international textile manufacturing center. The textile sector in Egypt is majority controlled by state owned companies which are poorly managed with outdated technologies. The project will transfer management expertise, technological know-how, and a proven quality control system to Egypt and help support the modernization of the sector.  

- Domestic value addition:

Currently, Egypt exports the majority of its production of cotton. The project will add value to this raw material through further processing, thus increasing government tax revenue and contributing to export earnings for Egypt. In addition, the project will enhance the skills of the local workforce through training and management and technology transfer.

Within this broad framework, IFC seeks to provide long-term finance and risk management products for increased investment in infrastructure, as well as support viable projects in key growth sectors. In Indonesia, WBG assistance aims at public sector reform, disaster risk management, increased financing for poverty alleviation, and stronger partnerships to improve the business environment and infrastructure development. IFCs proposed engagement with a smaller regional company in the upstream oil and gas sector investment is therefore aligned with strategic objectives for the WBG engagement in Indonesia and Thailand.Development Impact:- Enhanced Availability of a Cleaner Fuel:  The Project will support the development of natural gas reserves, in line with WBG commitments following the EIR. The increased availability of natural gas will promote the use of a cleaner fuel (given that natural gas has much lower carbon emissions than coal which is frequently the alternative fuel for power generation in Southeast Asia). - Preservation and Creation of Employment: The Project will have a sustaining impact on existing employment levels in producing assets and will contribute to the creation of new jobs in assets about to enter into production. For example, - the ONWJ and SES assets currently provide more than 1,400 permanent jobs and over 1,000 temporary/construction jobs, and - the bringing into production of the Kambuna and Bualuang assets is expected to generate an additional 150 permanent jobs. Salamander staff positions are generally remunerated at a 25%-30% premium to other comparable employment. The percentage of nationals in managerial positions tends to be high, mostly above 75%.   Contribution to Central and Local Government Revenues: The project will generate significant fiscal receipts from a combination of royalties (12.5%), corporate taxes (41.5%-50.0%), production sharing (42% to 71%) and obligations to supply domestic consumers at below-market prices. A material portion of these  approximately 15% of royalties in Thailand and 15-30% of total government payments in Indonesia  is expected to ultimately accrue to the regions where the oil and gas activities are undertaken. Generating Additional Business for Local and National Suppliers: The project is expected to have a positive impact on national and regional economic activity through the purchasing of equipment, products and services. For example, in 2008 contracts worth more than $45 million are expected to be sourced from regional and national suppliers in Indonesia and Thailand.Promoting Competition and Attracting FDI in Frontier Countries: The project promotes competition in the oil and gas sector through the growth of one of very few independent E&P companies exclusively focused on Southeast Asia. The participation of smaller privately-owned companies is important to the industry, as they - often focus on reserves deemed too small to be of interest to the majors and the national oil companies which dominate the sector in Southeast Asia, and - deliver production and recovery rates which tend to be above industry averages. In addition, if the company is successful in its exploration efforts in frontier/IDA countries such as Vietnam and Lao, the project will help demonstrate the viability of investment by small independents in their upstream sectors."

The end-user will benefit by having access to reliable broadband data and voice service at better qualities and lower costs leading to further economic development in rural areas. Increased access to telecommunication will indirectly contribute to economic growth; a recent McKinsey study cites that a 10% increase in tele-density contributes to 0.6% of GDP growth.- Expand Access to Telecoms in emerging markets, including rural areas: Existing telecom access solutions have substantial infrastructure requirements. Such infrastructure is typically available in high tele-density urban and semi-urban markets but is difficult to extend to low tele-density rural markets with poor infrastructure. Traditional telecom networks have only incidentally benefited villages in the periphery of well-connected urban centers and major transportation lines. Rural teledensity in India currently stands at 8% as compared with approximately 60% in urban areas.  The Indian government aims to provide mobile phone access to an additional 270 million people, and to expand the geographical coverage by 20%. Midas low-cost telecom solutions are specifically designed to meet the needs of rural populations, and fit well with the governments plans to increase rural teledensity in India.   - Support an Indian IT product company that is developing core intellectual property: The Indian IT industry contributes more than 4% to GDP and accounts for more than 20% of exports, yet the Indian IT market is primarily comprised of services companies. India regularly produces world-class engineers but this talent has typically immigrated to the United States to find challenging work.  An investment in Midas would support and demonstrate the ability to product promising, world class technology companies in India. - Support a company located in a region has not seen significant private equity/venture stage investment: Most IT investments are focused on companies based in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai or Delhi.

In July 2007, MDM signed an Energy Efficiency Advisory Agreement with IFC and allocated $20 million from the previously provided IFCs $100 million credit line to energy efficiency loans specifically for SMEs.  In December 2007 the energy efficiency product was officially launched by the Bank and today energy efficiency financing is available for SMEs in 47 Russian cities.  IFCs A loan under this project is aimed at helping MDM Bank to expand its energy efficiency financing to this broader segment of businesses in Russia. Energy prices are increasing rapidly in Russia.  However, many industrial companies are still using energy-intensive equipment that was installed more than 20 years ago  nearly 48% of production assets in Russia date from before 1985.  Company managers take an overly conservative view when it comes to assessing energy efficiency potential.  Financial institutions, on the other side, are reluctant to finance energy efficiency loans due to the higher perceived risk and longer-term financing requirements.  IFCs investments complemented with dedicated technical assistance will enable the Bank to provide long-term energy efficiency loans at attractive rates.  Lower energy cost will improve companies cash flows and increase their competitiveness.  The increased modernization level of the companies will support a sustainable growth of the economy.  Also, the reduction in the energy consumption will translate into CO2 emission reduction while maintaining the same level of economic output, which in its course, will decrease the greenhouse effect and contribute to the slowing down of the climate change.

"3471","Cairn India II",26763,2008-03-31 04:00:00,"South Asia","Fit with World Bank Groups Strategy:The proposed IFC investment is consistent with the WBGs strategic priorities in India.The current World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India focuses on improving government effectiveness; investing in people and empowering communities; and promoting private sector-led growth. The strategy for promoting private-sector led growth is further elaborated in the World Bank Groups Private Sector Development Strategy, appended to the CAS, which proposes that the World Bank and IFC work closely together to: - facilitate greater competitiveness;- improve the quantity and quality of infrastructure through greater private participation;- promote the provision of private health services; and - improve rural productivity and growth through greater private investment. IFC will focus on providing firms with long-term debt and equity which may not be available from domestic financial markets; and on adding value in the areas of global best practices, creating international partnerships, entering new markets, environmental and social sustainability and corporate governance. - Development Impact:Since the mid-1990s, India has implemented policy changes to encourage private investment in its upstream oil and gas sector. Although success remains modest, a number of foreign companies, such as Cairn, have successfully entered the sector. IFCs proposed investment reflects its continuing commitment to enhance the role of the private sector in the upstream hydrocarbons sector in India and help private companies meet the infrastructure challenges related to their activities. The proposed transaction will therefore build on the development impacts envisaged during our previous engagements with Cairn: - Development of Fuel Transportation Infrastructure:Cairns construction of an approximately 600 km crude oil transportation pipeline will help bring the fuel from the large Rajasthan discoveries to market hubs where it can be refined and further distributed to meet Indias growing energy demand. The potential use of this pipeline can later extend beyond Cairns Rajasthan Block to other blocks in Rajasthan where exploration activities are ongoing.- Enhancing Availability of Higher-Quality, Domestic Fuel:The Project is expected to reduce the reliance of Indias power sector and small industry on supplies of relatively inferior coal and more expensive naphtha, respectively. - Benefits to Government: It is expected that the governments of India will receive substantial fiscal receipts from royalties, production sharing and corporate taxes, generated by the oil production from the Project. A sizeable portion of these fiscal payments will accrue to the state government of Rajasthan in the form of royalties.- Import Substitution: At its currently projected production rate of more than 150,000 barrels per day, oil production from the Project would equate to approximately 18% of Indias indigenous oil production and 6% of Indias oil import volumes (both as of 2005/2006 fiscal year). - Creation and Preservation of Direct and Indirect Employment: The Project is expected to generate 450-500 jobs during peak operations (approximately 2,500 during the construction period), benefiting the local community through increased employment opportunities both directly and indirectly.  The Company encourages local hiring in its areas of operations to the extent possible.- Supporting Growth of an Indian Private Oil & Gas Company:Following Cairns discovery of oil in Rajasthan, Cairn took the decision to introduce local shareholding to its Indian operations.  The outcome was the creation of a publicly traded Indian company that has Indian ownership and Indian management.- Supporting Local Communities:  Cairn supports a wide range of community development activities in all its operations. Its work is concentrated in five main areas  health, education, local entrepreneurship development, environment and infrastructure  and benefits from effective co-ordination with local government, NGOs and media. Cairn is currently placing significant emphasis on meeting local community expectations for value-added employment opportunities, as well as further improvements of water infrastructure, medical services, health education, etc.  The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are:- annual production of hydrocarbons,- direct employment levels,- production sharing and fiscal payments accruing to the governments of Rajasthan and India, and- implementation of community development programs."

IFCs strategy in Tunisia is to focus on where IFC can add value and foster private sector development especially in sectors currently not properly serviced by Tunisian commercial banks, including the oil and gas sector. The proposed IFC investment is therefore fully consistent with this strategy.- Development Impact:- Benefits to Government of TunisiaThe project is expected to provide GoT with considerable revenues from TOPICs operations in HelM, through the collection of a 10-15% royalty and a 50-75% profit tax (current estimate of about $133 million in revenues to GoT by end of 2012 under IFCs base case).  TOPIC will also have an obligation, as per Tunisias Hydrocarbon Code, to sell 20% of its oil production to the local Tunisian market at a 10% discount to international prices.- Direct and indirect local employment and training:The proposed project and continued growth of the company is expected to bring direct and indirect local employment and training.  It is estimated that the development of HelM alone will generate 200 direct and indirect jobs during construction and 100 during operations. All TOPICs staff are currently Tunisian and it is expected that at least 90% of direct and indirect jobs created will be local.- Local supplier linkages / community development:The proposed project is expected to benefit local communities by way of purchases of local goods and services.  For example, the construction of the production facility for HelM will be built at the port of Sfax, in Tunisia, and will require substantial inputs from local industrial and marine subcontractors.  Over 50% of Project capex is expected to be sourced locally.- Promoting local independent player:The project will support one of the very few locally-owned private sector North African upstream companies and help it grow and reach international best practice on environmental and social issues and corporate governance."

To address the critical situation, the Government of Turkey (GOT) has embarked on implementing an on-going liberalization program of the Turkish electricity sector, including the preparation for the privatization of state-owned electricity distribution and generation assets. Consequently, several of the local private groups, many of which are already auto generators for their own industries, have begun expanding their power generating capacity, either independently or by the means of partnerships with experienced international power operators. Despite the growing risk appetite from commercial lenders to finance power generation assets, the sector exhibits significant commercial risks and regulatory uncertainties during the transition period, impeding the availability of long-term financing for the merchant power projects, in the absence of long-term power purchase agreements (PPA).The project will have a high development impact as it will: - contribute to the development of a merchant power operator in Turkey where ongoing structural and regulatory changes have introduced additional uncertainty for prospective investors; - finance the construction of power generation capacity of approximately 1.9 GW and meet incremental power demand in Turkey given the expected supply shortage in 2009; - support the power sector reforms in Turkey as the plants built within the scope of the project will not benefit from any government guarantees contrary to the existing independent power producers. Moreover, the project is expected to demonstrate the viability of a liberalized power sector to other potential private entrants to the sector.  Due to its reliance on hydro and natural gas as energy sources, the project will contribute to reducing Turkeys reliance on coal, thereby reducing carbon intensity and improving security of supply."

- Recapitalization:  

One of the financial sector's most pressing needs is the infusion of fresh Tier I capital into the system.  The proposed investment will help recapitalize a major player and will go a long way to improve the system's solvency issues.

- Restoring the Banking Sector's Credibility:  

The need for intervention of Bancomer and Bancaf<e9> put the regulatory authorities in an awkward position and has partly undermined the sector's credibility, even though the authorities managed to reduce wide spread damage.  The fact that a foreign institution will invest in Tier I capital will enhance Banco GyT's credibility and bolster the sector's overall image.

- Reducing Fragmentation: 

Given its size, Guatemala's banking industry has too many players, and they therefore have not been able to reach the crucial size to achieve efficiency levels common in this sector in other countries.  The investment in a leading player's Tier I capital will equip it to grow its balance sheet and have the means to acquire smaller competitors in the domestic market.  Thus, the proposed investment will contribute to further consolidation.

- South-to-South Investments:  

As part of its strategic plan, Banco GyT intends to further expand into neighboring countries through merger and acquisitions.  A stronger capital base will facilitate the implementation of the client's expansion.

- Access to Finance:  

Guatemala is one of the most under-banked markets in Latin America, but banks with economies of scale and higher efficiencies are better prepared to provide access to financial services to underserved regions.

Creation/preservation of local employment and sourcing in Argentina: 

ROCH currently employs 105 people directly and over 40 people through subcontractors in the provinces of Tierra de Fuego, Santa Cruz, Mendoza, and Rio Negro. The project will help to secure these jobs by extending the life of ROCH's hydrocarbon fields. During drilling and construction operations, a significantly larger number of people are expected to be hired through local and regional contractors. This will provide an alternative source of income to local people, whose employment alternatives are mainly restricted to the agribusiness sector.  The project will also have an impact on regional economic activity through local purchasing.

Contribution to Government revenues:

"3552","Tata Ultra Mega",25797,2007-11-27 05:00:00,"South Asia","According to the electricity consumption statistics of the International Energy Agency, India has a very low per capita consumption of electricity at about 437 kWh per annum as compared to its counter part emerging economies of China (about 1528 kWh) and Brazil (about 1941 kWh) and much lower than developed economies of United States (about 12541 kWh) and Japan (about 7701 kWh). The country faces severe shortages of about 11% of energy demand and 14% of peak power demand. The regions of the country where the project will supply its generation are the worst affected by the power crisis with energy shortages ranging from 7% to 19% and peak power shortages ranging from 10% to 30% of demand.  The low availability of power is seriously hampering industrial growth/competitiveness and corresponding economic benefits to the country. Lack of growth in power generation capacity and associated transmission and distribution network is one of the most critical factors for India to sustain its current GDP growth rate. It is expected that India needs to add about 160,000 MW in generation capacity in the next 10 years in order to sustain its current GDP growth rate of about 8  9% per annum. This implies that India needs to more than double its current generation capacity of about 132329 MW in the next 10 years which will require huge efforts and investments from both national and state governments as well as the private sector including international investors. The significance of this target is immense considering that India has been able to add only about 40195 MW in generation capacity in the last 10 years. Large power plants such as the proposed project will play a significant role in achieving the capacity addition targets in the envisaged timeframe and will help the country sustain its growth levels leading to overall economic development of Indias large population.  The project will provide a competitive source of electricity to partly reduce the current power shortages and help meet the growing demand for electricity in the country. Cheap and reliable power from the project will help in improving the competitiveness of Indian manufacturing and services industries which have to often rely on expensive standby diesel generation to fulfill their power needs. Competitively priced power will also improve access to electricity in rural and urban areas of the country while reducing the subsidy burden on state governments. Therefore, the project will have significant impact not only in terms of reducing the prevalent demand supply gap but in reducing the average electricity costs in the country leading to improved access and industrial competitiveness.The project will have the following additional development impacts:- Employment: The project will create an estimated 5000 jobs during construction and 700 jobs during operation. This significant creation of employment will lead to economic benefits in the project area and further development of additional economic activities leading to incremental employment.- Growth in port and transmission capacity: The project will source its coal through the Mundra Port which is undergoing a large expansion, a part of which (corresponding to approximately $200 million) will be utilized by the project. The transmission system is also being expanded, at an estimated cost of over $1 billion, to accommodate incremental power from the project. Both these facilities will result in large additional investment in the country and corresponding job creation and economic development.  Growth in transmission capacity will result in strengthening of the inter-state grid system which will enable early development of future power plants which would use these facilities for transmission of their generation to different parts of the country leading to improved access.- Tax transfers: The project will make significant tax payments to GoI, estimated at over $350 million over the life of the project. Growth in the associated facilities and imports for the project will lead to significant additional tax and custom duty payments to the government.- Social and Environmental: Lack of access to electricity (which is dependent on availability and price) has significant deleterious impacts on health, natural resources and environment. Burden of these impacts is often borne disproportionately by women, children and other vulnerable groups. The project will contribute to enhanced access to electricity through supply of cheap and reliable power.- Lower GHG emission intensity: While the total GHG emissions may be high, the GHG emissions per KWh of energy generated from the project will be about 750 gCO2/kWh as compared to 1259 gCO2/kWh (national average India for coal based power plants, 2005), 919 gCO2/kWh (world average for coal based power plants, 2005) and 888 gCO2/kWh (OECD average for coal based power plants, 2005). The project will have a GHG emission intensity which is lower by 40%, 18% and 15% as compared to the average GHG emission intensity of coal based power plants in India, across the globe and OECD.  The project will use about 10.8 million tonnes of coal annual to generate 29,000 million kWh of electricity (net), emitting about 23.4 million tonnes of CO2, based on the imported coal calorific value of 5,750 kcal/kg and 40.5% efficiency (net, HHV) of supercritical technology.  A typical subcritical power plant recently developed in India has generating efficiency of around 35% (net, HHV), and is likely to use 24.1 million tonnes of coal (domestic), emitting 28.8 million tonnes CO2, or 12.5 million tonnes of imported coal, emitting 27 million tonnes CO2, to generate the same amount of electricity.  Assuming both plants use the same imported coal, the project will avoid the burning of 1.7 million tonnes of coal per annum, resulting in a reduction of carbon emissions of 3.6 million tonnes CO2 per year."

Greater access to financial services by populations currently excluded from the formal banking sector will help reduce poverty and expand economic opportunity for low-income populations throughout Pakistan, especially women.  Through provision of a loan to Kashf, IFC would help finance Kashf increased outreach and portfolio growth.  If a guarantee is used, this would also improve the ability of Kashf to source local funds in the future which will reduce foreign exchange risk and borrowing costs.  By assisting in the establishment of a for-profit, national and fully-regulated microfinance bank, IFC would help demonstrate the profitability and sustainability of large-scale financial services to potential new or currently-limited microfinance providers. This is particularly important to encourage new entrants and greater overall penetration given the large unmet demand for financial services for the poor in Pakistan.  Through Kashf and KMB the project will contribute to the expansion of financial services to low income entrepreneurs and wage earners. By 2010 Kashf alone will have an outstanding loan balance of $480 million equivalent and over 1 million borrowers, the vast majority of which are expected to be women. Combined outreach of the two entities is expected to be reach 1.3 million borrowers and a portfolio of over $750 million. Importantly, KMB will be licensed to mobilize savings and expects to attract over 1 million new deposit clients, thus providing low-income populations with greater financial options, revenue-generating opportunities and safe-keeping for their assets.

This transaction complements the development outcomes achieved out of IFC's previous project with Rain, which eliminated the primary use of fossil fuels by the Company's operations.  The single largest development impact of the transaction is that over the five year transaction horizon, the generation of an estimated 825,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent will be eliminated, while a total of 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide will be eliminated assuming an estimated 15 year life of the project.  Through supporting an Indian company gain access to carbon finance in the way this transaction is structured, the project could encourage similar deals with local companies.

"3568","Peru LNG",25390,2007-11-06 05:00:00,"Latin America and the Caribbean","Fit With World Bank Group Strategy:The Word Bank Groups (WBG) Peru Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) is built upon three strategic pillars to support Perus efforts to increase economic growth and competitiveness, reduce poverty and inequality, and strengthen the countrys public institutions.  Within this overall framework, IFCs strategy focuses on: - working to reduce Peru''s large informal sector with technical assistance; - investing and developing projects which address bottlenecks to the provision of basic services and physical infrastructure; - investing in industries with strong competitive advantages such as agribusiness and tourism; - expanding growth to new beneficiaries including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), housing, and tertiary education finance, and by building local government capacity to deliver services; and - supporting sustainable growth, notably in extractive industries, a key sector within the countrys economy.Specifically, the expected fit between the project and the WBG CPS for Peru is evident in a number of areas.  The project will be developed in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner, i.e. with a minimal footprint during both construction and operation, thereby adequately mitigating environmental impacts, and augmenting social benefits for the surrounding region.  The project will further enhance the countrys gas pipeline infrastructure and provide Peru, as well as the wider regions, first internationally competitive LNG liquefaction facility.  In addition, the significant increase in natural gas production to supply the project will also result in an increase of associated liquids (condensates) which will become available for consumption in Peru, thereby reducing the need for expensive imports and potentially serving as the basis for further development of downstream industries such as petrochemicals.  The project is expected to convert Peru into a net exporter of hydrocarbons after 2010. Anticipated Development Impact:This project will support the monetization of hydrocarbons in Peru. While the country has modest reserves of liquid hydrocarbons, it has significant reserves of natural gas. The project will contribute to the development and strengthening of the country''s natural gas infrastructure, and will play a part in satisfying the growing domestic demand for hydrocarbons.  In addition the project will significantly impact both regional and national economic growth over the coming years through a combination of local investment, generation of export revenues, taxes, and royalties.  Looking at the wider region beyond Peru, a majority of Peru LNGs exports are destined for Manzanillo, Mexico, where the gas will be fed into the national grid as a cleaner fuel for electricity generation (replacing fuel oil), and/or domestic consumption, or may also used as feedstock for petrochemical production thereby serving an important development purpose for Mexico as well as Peru. Specifically, the project is expected to generate the following development impacts:- Creating Local Employment:During the planning and construction phases, the project will generate over 5,200 skilled and unskilled, direct and indirect jobs.  During the operating phase, 150 to 200 direct jobs will be created at Pampa Melchorita, with additional jobs being created upstream in gas production, and indirectly through supplier businesses.  From engineers to security personnel and administrative support, a vast majority of the Projects staff will be Peruvian.  Peru LNG expects that over $1 billion of the Project investment will be in local goods and services, primarily centered around the LNG Plant site. - Contribution to Peruvian Government Revenue:It is expected that the Government of Peru will receive substantial fiscal receipts in the form of corporate taxes, paid by Peru LNG, as well as royalties and taxes generated from the production of hydrocarbons by the upstream Camisea project.  In the longer term, the average tax revenue generated from the Project alone is expected to exceed $100 million per annum.  Incremental royalties generated by supplying the Project with gas for export are expected to exceed $225 million per annum.  A sizeable portion of these revenues will accrue directly to the regions impacted by this Project and the upstream Camisea project.- Community Development:Peru LNG is developing a broad community engagement program in line with its commitment to the sustained economic development of the neighboring communities of Pampa Melchorita, and those located along the Projects pipeline route.  IFC in partnership with Peru LNG are building on the companys existing social development programs to develop new areas for collaboration to enhance local benefits.  Specifically, IFC is exploring projects with the company and sponsors to: - Improve the companys social investment strategy, and enhance stakeholder participation in its design and implementation through the development of third party evaluation and monitoring capacity; - Enhance the companys strategy on local procurement to advance the inclusion of SMEs in its supply chain thereby promoting the long term sustainability of local businesses, and contribution to the local economy; and - Develop a program to further enhance the capacity of local governments in the management and use of tax revenues, in addition to improving social accountability to increase the impact of local public investments. The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are: - Annual LNG sales;- Annual taxes paid to the Government of Peru by PLNG; - Annual direct jobs created;- Annual spending with local businesses; and- Implementation of community development programs including governance capacity."

Insurance companies have a disproportionately high impact on economies because they are necessarily large investors who directly affect the general economy through their operations.  In order to settle claims that may arise, insurers invest excess premium income to build a portfolio of financial assets and income-producing real estate which can then be called upon to pay-off any future claims that may arise.  Therefore, a vibrant insurance industry can be a reliable source of long-term capital, which is lacking in Colombia.

Specific development benefits from the project are expected to include: - Enhancing Availability of Cleaner Fuel: The investment will support the exploration for and development of natural gas reserves in Russia, in line with World Bank Group commitments following the Extractive Industries Review. The increased availability of natural gas will promote the increased use of a cleaner fuel (given that natural gas has much lower carbon emissions than coal which is frequently the alternative fuel for power generation in Russia). - Promoting Competition and Private Sector Participation in the Gas Sector:The Russian upstream gas industry is dominated by state-controlled Gazprom. The participation of smaller privately-owned companies is important to the industry, as they often focus on reserves deemed too small to be of interest to larger players. More importantly, these smaller private companies deliver production and recovery rates that tend to be higher than industry averages. - Sustaining and Increasing Local Employment: The project will have a sustaining impact on existing employment levels and will potentially contribute to new job creation in one of Russias frontier regions. The company currently employs 55 people in Russia, all locals in Saratov oblast. It is expected that the number of permanent jobs may potentially double as Vostok expands its operations, with even more employment created during the construction phase. In addition, there is expected to be a considerable benefit through employment of local contractors and subcontractors (e.g. providing oilfield services). - Contributions to Central and Local Government Revenue:  The project will generate fiscal receipts from hydrocarbon production taxes, rent and corporate taxes. A material portion of these receipts (100% of Property Tax payments and over 70% of Corporate Income Tax payments) will be remitted to the oblast government and thus contribute to the development of one of Russias frontier regions. - Enhanced Support for Local Communities: With the implementation of the project, Vostok is expected to step-up its activities in the Bortovoe license block. The communities surrounding these new operations will benefit with Vostoks tailored support programs.

By assisting SCB to distribute the credit risk exposure of a percentage of its MFI portfolio, the transaction will enable SCB to leverage the coverage and delivery capacity of its unique network in the emerging markets of Asia and Africa.  The transaction structure will open a new avenue for SCB and possibly others in a similar position, to sell down the micro finance risk in the international capital markets.  What this ultimately means is that this transaction is a precursor to opening up international capital markets for MFI customers in emerging markets.  If this and similar initiatives are successful it could mean a quantum increase in the available resources for the MFI sector in many markets.  Moreover, as this transaction improves SCBs efficiency in allocating its capital, it will encourage SCB to continue investing in this business.As the transaction has a geographically diversified asset portfolio, it affords the opportunity to a wide range of potential international investors to support the MFI sector that otherwise do not have any practical or efficient means to do so.

Access to modern lighting will positively impact these populations in several ways. Fuel-based lighting is an expensive solution that provides a low quality service of light, and hinders development. For instance, concerning households living standards, fuel-based lighting can account for as much as 15% of a household income. In addition, it is a safety hazard and common source of fires. Furthermore, it contributes to indoor air pollution and related health problems. Concerning social development, poor lighting directly impacts educational performance. Concerning small businesses, such as night street vendors, the high cost of fuel-based lighting limits evening operating hours, and the low quality of the light limits customer traffic and sales, hence the overall productivity of small businesses. Access to modern and affordable off-grid lighting services can revert these conditions and significantly improve the living standards of households, and the productivity of very small businesses. The project targets for the pilot in Kenya and Ghana a market penetration of as much as 10% in 10 years, which translates into 1,500,000 end-users with modern, off-grid lighting products by 2015 in the two countries.

Following the gas disruption crisis from Argentina, a number of investment decisions to build new thermal plants in Chile have been postponed due to uncertainty in gas availability and pricing.  Further, the gas crisis has lead to an increase in the cost of electricity supply in Chile as it was necessary at times for thermal units to burn diesel oil instead of gas.The project is a low cost producer of renewable energy and will contribute to the expansion of hydroelectric generation capacity in the Central Interconnected System of Chile (SIC) which supplies the central zone of the country. The primary objective of the project is to help meet electricity demand growth in the SIC, which averaged about 6% per year from 2003 to 2006. As the projects water inflows are primarily determined by snow and glacier melting, the projects hydrology is not closely correlated with that of the system. Hence, it is expected that the project will be available to dispatch at full load from November through March during the dry season, when the hydrology in the system is below average and the SIC has a higher dependency on more expensive thermal generation.

The environmental and associated health impacts of a principally coal fired economy are of increasing concern, and development of local natural gas resources, including CBM, can be part of the solution to alleviate these problems.  Compared to coal-fired electricity, natural gas use produces virtually no emissions of sulfur dioxide, mercury or particulate matter, 80% less NOx, and approximately 50 percent less CO2.  Increasing the use of natural gas helps reduce acid rain, smog, regional haze, and their associated health impacts, including asthma attacks, cardiac problems and upper and lower respiratory ailments. 

China is the world's second largest consumer of oil after the U.S. and the third largest net importer of oil after the U.S. and Japan.  The development of a local energy source can help alleviate concerns of energy security.  Furthermore, the government will reap benefits from fiscal revenues, royalties, and taxes.

The government of China is taking measures to diversify its energy supply, with the aim of increasing the proportion of clean energy in the mix.  China's natural gas usage is projected to increase from the current 3.2% of the nation's energy mix to 8.0% by 2020.  In order to meet this target, CBM & CMM development and utilization has been identified as a priority in China's 11th 5-Year Development Plan.  China has considerable potential for CBM development, but as yet projects are mainly at the exploration stage and there is limited commercial production.  There are several barriers to overcome to move projects from the exploration to development and production stage, including access to advanced technology and equipment, technical expertise, necessary market access and downstream infrastructure for CBM sales, and project financing of a frontier sector in the country. 

Development benefits at the gas production stage include environmental and associated health benefits from cleaner energy, increased energy security from local energy source, employment, and fiscal revenues (royalties, taxes, and government ownership interests in CBM production).

"3677","Pan American Energy LLC - Argentine Branch (II)",25838,2007-06-01 04:00:00,"Latin America and the Caribbean"," - Fit with World Bank Group Strategy:The World Bank Groups (WBG) current program in Argentina focuses on sustained growth, coupled with enhanced equity, social inclusion and improved governance.  IFCs priorities for its direct investments is to provide long-term financing and structured finance products to companies and projects in strategic sectors with a focus on groups expanding on a South-South basis and export-oriented or export facilitating projects.  Strategic focus sectors are oil, gas, mining, agribusiness, and the financial sector.  The proposed IFC investment is fully consistent with this strategy. - Development Impact:Contribution to Alleviate Tight Gas Market in Argentina:Gas demand growth outpaced gas supply in recent years in Argentina.  The gap has been driven on the one hand by the sustained economic expansion experienced in recent years, fuelled mainly by the growth in the industrial sector and increased use of CNG in vehicles, and further enhanced by the distortion of energy prices, and, on the other, by the investment lag in developing gas reserves as a result of the new context.  PAE is one of the few companies in Argentina that has grown its gas reserves and production during the last five years.  Today, gas represents over 50% of the companys proven reserves.  Part of the 2007 investment in the project will go toward increasing gas production, which will help alleviate the current gas shortage in Argentina.  Creation/Preservation of Employment:PAE is a key employer in the regions where it operates, especially in the Golfo San Jorge basin where it employs 575 direct staff and almost 6,400 contractors.  The IFC investment will contribute to the companys growth, which has lead to an average of 100 new direct jobs created per annum since 2003. In addition, the investment will help maintain employment levels on a company-wide basis in the provinces of Chubut and Santa Cruz, where the oil and gas industry offers significant employment opportunities.Local Purchasing and Development of SMEsPAE procures most of its goods and services in Argentina from over 1,500 suppliers and contractors. In 2006, PAE spent approximately $728 million on Argentine investments, goods and services.  PAEs efforts to develop Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the Golfo San Jorge area help maximize the impact of this local purchasing.  This PAE corporate program launched in 2005 has as its objective the promotion of sustainable economic development through supplier development, government capacity building, and access to finance.Support for Local Communities:PAE has developed a strong positive relationship with the local communities in each of its areas of operation.  Its commitment to sustainable community development is exemplified through the companys support for numerous social development activities focused on the key areas of education, health, employment and environment.  PAE has also engaged with a number of NGOs to identify opportunities for additional social investment and enjoys broad community support throughout its operations.Benefits to Government:PAE contributes significant fiscal revenues to all levels of government.  During 2006, PAE made an estimated $1 billion in payments to various levels of government consisting of income taxes, royalties, export tariffs and other taxes.  The company submits on a quarterly basis financial statements as part of its obligations to Argentinas National Securities Commission, and such disclosures are available publicly.  PAE is expected to remain a significant contributor of tax revenues for both the federal and regional budgets and is also expected to continue contributing to Argentinas foreign currency earnings and over the life of the IFC loans.Indicators to monitor development impact include: - gas production, - payments to government, - employment maintained/created, - purchases from local and national suppliers, and - investment in social and community development."

In addition, Maples proposed investments may potentially lead to new hydrocarbon discoveries. - Creation of Markets and Production of Renewable Bio-fuels:Maples entry into the production of bio-ethanol using locally harvested sugar cane grown on its own land using state-of-the-art irrigation drip systems will boost the agricultural sector in Piura, promote the use of efficient irrigation technology in the Chira river basin, and produce a renewable, less polluting indigenous fuel.  Maples ethanol production will allow for exports to international markets and will also be available for mixing with domestic gasoline which is expected to become mandatory in Peru in 2010. - Contribution to Peruvian Government Revenue:The project facilitates the production and sale of hydrocarbons and ethanol which provides an important source of revenue to the country through both upstream royalties and corporate income taxes. - Creating Local Employment and Sourcing in Peru:Maples various operations currently directly employ approximately 400 people in Peru. The planned upstream activities are expected to provide additional employment opportunities and exposure to skilled employment to Peruvians. In addition, Maples new ethanol venture will create direct new employment opportunities in Peru associated with the cultivation and subsequent harvesting of land to be planted with cane and the construction and operation of an industrial ethanol distillery.

IFCs strategic objective outlined in the WBG strategy is to focus on: - supporting PPI initiatives, - assisting the development of new financial sector institutions and instruments for the private sector,- catalyzing new private sector investment in manufacturing, petrochemicals, oil and gas, as well as the social sectors, and - supporting SME initiatives.In Bulgaria the objectives of WBG are to:- address productivity and employment; - implement fiscal sustainability and proper absorption of EU funds; and - target poverty reduction through social inclusion.  IFCs strategic objective outlined in the WBG strategy is to support Bulgarias EU integration by helping Bulgaria improve its competitiveness through supporting domestic companies and attracting foreign private investors in the country.  The proposed project is consistent with WBGs overall strategic priorities in these countries by developing its natural resources, attracting foreign investment and providing training and jobs, while helping the company to operate in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.Development ImpactThe project is expected to contribute to the benefits provided by Melroses continued operations as follows:- Promoting Natural Gas Development and Use:  The project will contribute to increased natural gas production in Egypt; production is expected to increase from an average 70 mmcf/d in 2005 to 200mmcf/d by year-end 2007.  Natural gas is believed to be the primary growth driver in the Egyptian energy sector.  Melroses operations support both the development of gas for domestic use and the governments strategy of promoting gas as a domestic fuel of choice.  Bulgaria has limited indigenous gas production and its domestic market for natural gas is still at an early stage of development.  The Galata field development, the first upstream oil and gas development undertaken by the private sector in Bulgaria, has supported the governments objectives to include the private sector and develop a competitive gas market.  In 2005, the company provided 16% of the natural gas consumed domestically.  The Project will contribute to sustaining this positive impact on the countrys gas sector.  Moreover, it is expected that the Galata field, upon depletion, will be used as a gas storage facility, thus strengthening Bulgaria''s role as a gas transit country with its corresponding revenue generating benefits.- Creation and Preservation of Direct and Indirect Employment:   The project will help sustain employment in both countries.  In Egypt, the operating company currently employs approximately 500 personnel and contractors, of which more than 95% are locals.  In addition, given the large development program envisioned over the next couple of years, the project is expected generate additional employment of about 200/300 contractors per annum.  In its Bulgarian operations, Melrose employs 43 people directly. Over 95% employees are locals. - Supporting Local Communities and Suppliers:  The company is committed to the local communities in which it operates, recognizing that engagement with the communities in the area of its operations is integral to the long-term success of its investments.  In Egypt, Melrose and its partner Merlon have contributed to schools, mosques and the construction of roads and other infrastructure within the concession areas.  In Bulgaria, the Company sponsors a daycare center for children with disabilities by providing heating fuel during the winter months and is presently rebuilding a local church.   In addition, with the exception of specialized equipment Melrose aims to procure approximately 70% and 70% of its purchases locally in Egypt and Bulgaria, respectively.  - Benefits to Government: The project benefits to Egypt and Bulgaria include continued revenues that will accrue to these governments in the form of production share, royalties and corporate taxes.  The estimated net present value of future aggregate revenues to the Government of Egypt (GoE) and Government of Bulgaria (GoB) is expected to be about $300 million and $5million, respectively, over the life of the proposed IFC investment, representing less than 0.09% and 0.01% of annual federal government revenues. (nb 2005 revenues - $9.9bn Bulgaria & $32.9bn Egypt)IFC plans to monitor the following development impacts for both Bulgaria and Egypt during the life of the IFC investment: - employment levels; - local/national purchasing; - production sharing and fiscal payments accruing to the governments of Egypt and Bulgaria; and - investments in community programs."

"3715","ACAP Thailand",25883,2007-05-04 04:00:00,"East Asia and the Pacific","The developmental impact of well-structured distressed debt transactions is well recognized.  Such transactions help improve the stability of  the banking system by encouraging transparency in balance sheets as true value of assets is exposed by the market value paid by buyers of NPLs and financial institutions are obligated to take losses and contribute additional capital where necessary.  This helps the banking system achieve a capital adequacy level that is more consistent with the actual risks in bank portfolios.  In addition the systematic and vigorous pursuit of NPLs contributes to the development of a much better credit culture especially in countries where the willingness to repay (as opposed to the ability to repay) has been the cause of serious portfolio problems in the banking systems which have had to be resolved at an enormous fiscal cost.

The project will help jump start the housing finance market to assist a majority of the population in the country to obtain housing finance to realize their dreams of owning their homes.- Privatization and institution-building of the countrys first private-sector housing finance company:HDFCL has not been able to develop its business and provide relief to the severe housing shortage in the country. It ceased operations due to lack of access long-term commercial funds and more fundamentally, due to its complete reliance on government guarantees which could not be sustained. A successfully privatized company, operating along the principles of being commercially viable and long-term sustainable, would generate great and sustained relief to the housing shortage situations in the country, improve the quality of life for many citizens, and contribute to creation of a vibrant financial sector of the country. - Development of housing related SME/supply industries: Through extensive linkage effects, the housing industry will contribute to the development of SMEs that supply labor and materials for the construction and improvement of homes, since most of the construction activity is conducted through contractors and the informal sector. Sufficient demand for the supplies provided by the informal sector would prompt development of such segments in the economy into more formal and better managed companies leading to a more professional construction sector.- Support the development of a new urban center: GoMs investment in Hulhumale and its efforts to spread the capital island thereby easing the pressure on Male, has not succeeded so far.

Avangard sources waste PET bottles from over 1,300 suppliers nationally and supply sites include waste separation centers, deposit centers, rural communities, schools and waste disposal sites.  At waste disposal sites individual garbage sorting and recycling workers (known in Mexico as 'pepenadores') labor in poor working conditions, very often as family units.  Petstar is developing a programmatic social engagement plan directly targeted at addressing this systemic issue, thereby reducing the incidence of harmful informal child labor within its supply chain. 

By converting waste drinking bottles into a usable, valuable manufacturing input, the project will support improved waste management in Mexico.  PET bottles are non-biodegradable, high-volume items that are causing an increasingly unsightly waste disposal problem throughout Mexico. By reducing the volume of waste entering landfills, PET recycling increases the life of existing sanitary landfills, supporting Mexico's limited waste management infrastructure. The project involves technology transfer of PET recycling equipment that is currently mainly used in developed countries and will provide a demonstration of a successful private sector recycling business in Mexico.

In doing so, the project will widen access to much-needed quality education. Illiteracy in Ghana is still close to 40%, and government spending on basic education has not kept up with population growth. According to World Bank estimates, Ghana is unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary completion by 2015 at current enrolment and spending rates. The poor quality of public education has given rise to enormous demand for private schools. This demand is currently unmet, in large part because schools have little access to affordable, long-term financing, and little training in financial management. This project will address both shortcomings. The project's technical assistance component will also help schools, by building their management capacity, to improve the quality of education provided, thus setting a standard for the private sector, where quality is highly variable and unregulated by the government. Finally, this project supports a successful and replicable model for reaching small education providers - which comprise the vast majority of private providers - throughout Africa (and other regions).

EAPCL is the only producer of PVC in Pakistan and since its inception has had a significant catalytic effect on investment in smaller scale, downstream processing capacity, notably for piping and construction applications.  The country has since seen an increased use of PVC in agriculture, particularly for drainage purposes which has made substantial contribution to agricultural productivity and introduction of micro-irrigation, resource saving and reversing long run declines in water quality and agricultural land management.  Given the impact of the existing operations, the PVC expansion and strengthening of the companys position, through its backward integration, will serve to continue these positive impacts on the market.The longer tenor of the IFC loan will help improve EAPCLs cash flow during the trough periods, while allowing it to make the investments required to maintain efficient and competitive operations.  This same factor proved critical to the Company for the first IFC investment, particularly during the down cycle years of 2001-2002 where the Company had experience shrinking margins.

The current energy crisis faced by Uganda has led to significant load shedding. As a result, the GoU is forced to rely on an additional 100 MW of expensive thermal power to mitigate the problem and has had to almost double tariffs in 2006. Some business users have resorted to importing backup diesel generators, but many other users cannot afford them. This is constraining economic growth, particularly in the industrial sector.The project will: - displace at least an estimated 50MW of expensive emergency thermal power when it is commissioned in 2011;- relieve residual load shedding; and - meet incremental base load demand with least cost power generation. This will prevent further rises in electricity tariffs and may allow a decrease. It will enable more residential users to be connected every year, including in rural areas. It will also allow industrial and commercial users to reduce their costs and increase their productivity, thereby boosting economic growth. Availability of cost effective electricity will also increase the attractiveness of Uganda as an investment destination. During the construction phase of the dam, the project is expected to create 600-1,100 jobs for Ugandan nationals, some 10% of whom are to be hired from local communities. The community development action plan (CDAP) for the project includes strengthening of educational and health services and provision of clean water to affected communities. By recycling the same water that is already used to generate power at Nalubaale and Kiira, the project reduces the pressure to over-release water from Lake Victoria, thereby helping to preserve lake levels and facilitate the GOUs compliance with the Agreed Curve.  Through the displacement of thermal power that would otherwise be needed, the project reduces carbon and other pollutant emissions.The project would be Ugandas first IPP and one of the largest mobilizations of private financing for an IPP project in Africa.

More specifically, IFC''s strategy for Egypt focuses on: - encouraging private investments in infrastructure, mining and hydrocarbon sector; - supporting export-oriented manufacturing; - technical assistance for SME development and the business enabling environment; and - supporting financial sector activities.  In recent years, crude oil production in Egypt has declined from 700,000 bpd in 2001/2 to an estimated 640,000 bpd in 2005/2006 due to lower production from maturing fields, while domestic demand has been rising. This has resulted in significant ongoing efforts to raise oil and gas production to meet domestic needs as well as to step up natural gas exports. The WBG is actively supporting these efforts; IFC has four existing oil and gas investments, and the World Bank is currently engaged in providing technical assistance to the Government of Egypt (GoE), on strengthening domestic natural gas distribution in the country. The proposed project fits well within the WBGs strategy for Egypt as it promotes the participation of the private sector and foreign direct investment in Egypts important hydrocarbons sector, especially in smaller fields that would otherwise be ignored by larger oil companies.Anticipated Development Impact of the Project:The hydrocarbon sector is important to the Egyptian economy, contributing nearly 10% of GDP and 53% of export earnings as well as drawing a significant share of foreign direct investment.  IFCs investment will continue to support foreign investment in Egypts hydrocarbon sector.  The country recently went from an oil exporter to an oil importer. Finally, IPR specializes in enhanced oil recovery and management of marginal and declining production fields.  This technology and expertise is being applied to extend the life of smaller fields that are of no interest to the larger oil companies. This technology is being shared with its partners, including the local oil company, Sahara Petroleum.  - Contributions to Government Revenue:Direct economic benefits for GoE in the form of Egyptian General Petroleum Corporations (EGPC) production share (includes IPRs share of royalties and income taxes).  - Creating and Providing Sustainable Local Employment:  IPR is an important source of local employment in the fields it operates, particularly in its largest field, Alamein Yidma, which, through the Joint Operating Company El Hamra Oil, employs 125 people, 90% of whom are Egyptian.  Overall, IPR employs approximately 250 people in Egypt, with the majority (90%) locals.  As the company has success in its exploration and development projects, it is likely that employment will grow. - Local Purchases of Goods and Services: Egypt has a thriving local oil services industry that will benefit from the project and will involve expenditures on local goods and services which will be tracked on an annual basis. Currently, IPR estimates that 70% of its annual purchases are spent locally. IFC will monitor the projects development impacts annually based on information provided by IPR in respect of: - annual contributions to government revenue, - local employment, and - purchases of local goods and services from local suppliers."

"3839","Madison Insuranc",25537,2006-11-13 05:00:00,"Africa","The potential developmental, institutional and capacity building impact of the project is high.  The capitalization proposed for Madison will help reinforce the local insurance industry in Zambia and help the company better compete with foreign based insurers in the local and regional markets. This will in turn reduce the amount of capital leaving the country for the accounts of non-Zambian insurers.IFC''s investment will help in the transformation of an existing local institution into a strong and viable private sector entity that will attract other foreign players into the Zambian insurance industry.  The investment will have an important demonstration effect in that it will result in an increase in the overall market size of private insurance in the country. Insurance companies have a disproportionately high impact on economies because they are necessarily large investors who directly affect the general economy through their operations.  In order to settle claims that may arise, insurers invest excess premium income to build a portfolio of financial assets and income-producing real estate which can then be called upon to pay off any future claims that arise.  A vibrant insurance industry can be a reliable source of long-term capital, which is lacking in Zambia as well as in many African countries.  The provision of quality insurance is therefore crucial for the development of a healthy and dynamic private sector and long-term capital markets."

"3851","Lonmin",24803,2006-10-12 04:00:00,"Africa","-  The Mining Industry in South AfricaIn 2005 the mining industry generated 7% of South Africas GDP. The importance of the industry to overall GDP has decreased slightly over the last 3 years, largely due to the growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors and contraction in the gold-mining industry. However, if the gross value-added contribution of processed minerals (presently included in the manufacturing sectors figures) were added to mining, along the extensive economic linkages with other sectors, the impact on national accounts would be significantly higher.During 2004, the mining industry employed 2.9% of South Africas economically active population. As the majority of South Africas mining operations are based in the rural areas of the country, the mining industry has spawned an extensive and efficient physical infrastructure and has contributed greatly to the establishment of secondary industries.  Recent legislation has tried to deepen the positive impacts of the mining industry on local communities and the national economy.The South African Mineral Resource and Petroleum Bill was legislated in 2004 with the following objectives: - to transfer custody of mineral rights from private holders to the Government; - to implement mining license reforms; and- to develop social empowerment through changes in ownership of mining companies; and other measures.As in other sectors, the legislation was aimed primarily at increasing participation of previously disadvantaged groups in the mining industry, both as shareholders and suppliers. This led to the creation of Black Economic Empowerment entities (BEEs), which are majority owned and managed by historically disadvantaged South Africans (HDSAs). The key element of this new charter was the requirement (beginning in 2004) for mining companies to sell 15% over 5 years to be further increased to 26% over 10 years to BEEs. In order to receive new order mining rights which reflect the companys compliance with the new legislation, all mining companies are expected to have met the 15% ownership requirement and completed a detailed Social and Labour Plan (among other requirements) by 2009.  Lonmins BEE partner is Incwala, which holds an 18% share in Lonmins two main South African subsidiaries. Lonmin, in turn, holds a 23% stake in Incwala.  Lonmin is on track to achieve the 26% BEE ownership goal by 2014. Lonmin was recently notified of the successful conversion of their old order mining rights to new order mining rights for its Marikana operations.  Lonmin is the first major platinum company in South Africa to receive the new order mining licenses.  The Company will work with the Department of Mines and Energy to set a timetable for the fulfillment of the undertakings in the Social and Labour Plan portion of their conversion application.  Meeting these objectives will ensure that they are in compliance with the South Africa Mining Charter.  The project is expected to have the following development impacts through its positive impact on the sector in South Africa:- Expansion of an internationally competitive mining operation:Lonmins activities generate significant benefits to South Africa in terms of employment, linkages with suppliers and taxes and revenues paid to national government and royalties paid to local communities. In the latest fiscal year, for example, the company employed 25,000 people in South Africa, paid $313m in salaries and benefits, paid $80m to government and spent $361m for materials and services, with 37% of total procurement spend going to HDSA suppliers.  Additionally, Lonmin pays royalties to the Bapo Ba Mogale tribe in the Marikana area as well as Traditional Authorities in Limpopo.  The major part of its output of over 900,000 oz platinum was exported. It is expected that all of these benefits will increase as a result of the expansion program.  In addition, the government will receive indirectly payroll tax payments made by employees of Lonmin. Lonmin will disclose all material tax and royalty payments in its annual report and accounts as required by statutory reporting authorities.- An Extensive Community and Local Economic Development Program:A major component of Lonmins future plans is its community development activities. Lonmin currently has a robust community development framework in place comprising a newly invigorated development trust and a social and community based function within their corporate structure. Community development is a core component of Lonmins charter and corporate strategy.  Lonmin hopes to grow these programs beyond their current capacity and will supplement their in-house expertise with IFCs expertise in design and implementation.  This project component is expected to have measurable positive impacts in the areas of HIV/AIDs prevention, Municipal Development, Gender equality and Local Economic Development (See also discussion of IFC Contribution). - Skills Development: Lonmins skills development and worker training is an integral part of its planned expansion program and Local Economic Development Program (LEDP) that will encourage and facilitate the greater engagement of local businesses and will address the skills shortage in South Africas labour force through increased functional and leadership training.  The expansion project will result in enhanced mechanical and other skills and capability. The LEDP will impart business skills and education to the greater community and facilitate greater small and medium size business commercial engagement with Lonmin and others.The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are: - annual production of PGM ounces;- Lonmins financial performance;- successful implementation of community development programs  based on objective measures of success (that will be developed with the company); and - fiscal payments accruing to the both the Federal and Municipal governments."

The SME sector, mostly privately owned, provides a significant proportion of employment of the country. A growing and robust SME sector is critical to help accelerate Chinas transition to a market economy. However due to the small scale of the SMEs, this sector has always been under served by banks which provide over 90% of funding to the economy. Among all the difficulties, lack of access to banks financing is always cited as the top challenge faced by SMEs. The proposed RMB loan under this project will be the first IFC loan to a local Chinese bank to support its SME lending. It will act as a catalyst to help mobilize more banks resources in SME business and hence to increase the accessibility of local SMEs to banks financial services.The proposed IFC loan combined with a technical assistance program will not only provide NCCB with the long term funding, but also help the bank develop an end-to-end process and methodology in terms of customer identification, risk-based pricing, system and product development, etc. If executed successfully the program can be potentially rolled out to other banks that have similar demand of NCCB.

In doing so, the project will enable schools to obtain financing from the formal banking sector and widen access to much-needed quality education. The enormous demand for private schools is currently unmet, in large part because schools have little access to affordable, long- or medium-term financing, and little training in financial management.

"3861","Cairn India",25474,2006-09-26 04:00:00,"South Asia","- Fit with WBG Strategy:The current World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India focuses on improving government effectiveness; investing in people and empowering communities; and promoting private sector-led growth. The strategy for promoting private-sector led growth is further elaborated in the World Bank Groups Private Sector Development Strategy, appended to the CAS, which proposes that the World Bank and IFC work closely together to: - facilitate greater competitiveness;- improve the quantity and quality of infrastructure through greater private participation;- promote the provision of private health services; and- improve rural productivity and growth through greater private investment. IFC will focus on providing firms with long-term debt and equity which may not be available from domestic financial markets; and on adding value in the areas of global best practices, creating international partnerships, entering new markets, environmental and social sustainability and corporate governance. The proposed IFC investment is therefore consistent with the WBGs strategic priorities in India.- Development Impact:Since the mid-1990s, India has implemented policy changes to encourage private investment in its upstream oil and gas sector. Although success remains modest, a number of foreign companies, such as Cairn, have successfully entered the sector. IFC''s proposed investment reflects its continuing commitment to enhance the role of the private sector in the upstream hydrocarbons sector in India. The proposed transaction, similar to the senior loan investment made by IFC earlier this year, is expected to have the following key development impacts:Enhancing Availability of Higher-Quality, Domestic Fuel: The project is expected to reduce the reliance of India''s power sector and small industry on supplies on relatively inferior coal and more expensive naphtha, respectively. - Import Substitution: At its currently projected peak plateau production rate of 150,000 bbl/d, the Rajasthan development would account for a significant portion of Indias indigenous oil production and help reduce its oil imports.- Creation and Preservation of Direct and Indirect Employment: In 2005 approximately 75% of Cairn Energy PLCs staff and contractors were local nationals. The Rajasthan development is expected to generate 450-500 jobs during peak operations (approximately 2,500 during the construction period), benefiting the local community through increased employment opportunities both directly and indirectly. - Supporting Local Communities:  Cairn supports a wide range of community development activities in all its operations.  Its work is concentrated in five main areas  health, education, local entrepreneurship development, environment and infrastructure  and benefits from effective co-ordination with local government, NGOs and media. Significant emphasis going forward is to be placed on meeting local community expectations for value-added employment opportunities, as well as further improvements of water infrastructure, medical services, health education, etc.- Benefits to Government:It is expected that the government of India will receive substantial fiscal receipts from royalties, production sharing and corporate taxes, generated by the incremental production to be achieved as a result of the proposed investment. Specifically in the case of Rajasthan, a sizeable proportion of fiscal payments will accrue directly to the state government in the form of royalties.The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are: - annual production of oil and gas in India, - direct employment levels, - production sharing and fiscal payments accruing to the governments of India, and - implementation of community development programs."

This project will support the monetization of hydrocarbons, particularly stranded natural gas reserves, in Peru.  It will not only explore, develop and produce natural gas, but will also create regional markets for natural gas.  Peru and Ecuador are two countries that are both desperate to increase their gas and electricity supplies.  BPZ's project will directly increase electricity supplies in Peru through the construction of the Caleta Cruz power plant, and will potentially increase electricity supplies in Ecuador by selling natural gas to power producers in Arenillas.

- Contribution to Peruvian Government Revenue:

The project facilitates the production and sale of gas and, possibly, liquids, which provide an important source of revenue to the country through royalties and taxes.

- Creating Local Employment and Sourcing in Peru:

The project will create direct new employment opportunities in Peru associated with the exploration and development of Block Z-1, construction and maintenance of the Caleta Cruz power plant and the potential construction of the pipeline to Ecuador.  The project will also have an impact on secondary employment through services provided by local contractors.

- Fuel Substitution and Transmission System Stability:

Since most thermal capacity in both Peru and Ecuador is diesel generated, IFC's support of the project will help to substitute the more expensive and more polluting imports of diesel and fuel oil for clean natural gas in both countries.  The project will reduce transmission constraints by reversing the flow of electricity from South to North.  The plant will also have an important role for providing stability to the system through its location at the end of a long line in the transmission network.

IFCs strategic objective outlined in the WBG strategy is to support Bulgarias EU integration by helping Bulgaria improve its competitiveness through supporting domestic companies and attracting foreign private investors in the country.  The proposed project is consistent with WBGs overall strategic priorities in these countries by developing its natural resources, attracting foreign investment and providing training and jobs, while helping the company to operate in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.- Development ImpactThe project is expected to contribute to the benefits provided by Melroses continued operations as follows:- Promoting Natural Gas Development and UseThe project will contribute to increased natural gas production in Egypt; production is expected to increase from an average 70 mmcf/d in 2005 to 200mmcf/d by year-end 2007.  Natural gas is believed to be the primary growth driver in the Egyptian energy sector.  Melroses operations support both the development of gas for domestic use and the governments strategy of promoting gas as a domestic fuel of choice.  Bulgaria has limited indigenous gas production and its domestic market for natural gas is still at an early stage of development.  The Galata field development, the first upstream oil and gas development undertaken by the private sector in Bulgaria, has supported the governments objectives to include the private sector and develop a competitive gas market.  In 2005, the company provided 16% of the natural gas consumed domestically.  The project will contribute to sustaining this positive impact on the countrys gas sector.  Moreover, it is expected that the Galata field, upon depletion, will be used as a gas storage facility, thus strengthening Bulgaria''s role as a gas transit country with its corresponding revenue generating benefits.- Creation and Preservation of Direct and Indirect EmploymentThe project will help sustain employment in both countries.  In Egypt, the operating company currently employs approximately 47 personnel and an average of 300 contractors per annum, of which more than 95% and 100%, respectively are locals.  In addition, given the large development program envisioned over the next couple of years, the project is expected generate additional employment of about 200/300 contractors per annum.  In its Bulgarian operations, Melrose employs 43 people directly and an average of 300 contracted staff per annum.  100% of direct personnel and 70% of the contracted employees are locals. - Supporting Local Communities and SuppliersThe company is committed to the local communities in which it operates, recognizing that engagement with the communities in the area of its operations is integral to the long-term success of its investments.  In Egypt, Melrose and its partner Merlon have contributed to schools, mosques and the construction of roads and other infrastructure within the concession areas.  In Bulgaria, the company sponsors a daycare center for children with disabilities by providing heating fuel during the winter months and is presently rebuilding a local church.   In addition, with the exception of specialized equipment Melrose aims to procure approximately 70% and 70% of its purchases locally in Egypt and Bulgaria, respectively.  - Benefits to GovernmentThe project benefits to Egypt and Bulgaria include continued revenues that will accrue to these governments in the form of production share, royalties and corporate taxes.  The estimated net present value of future aggregate revenues to the Government of Egypt (GoE) and Government of Bulgaria (GoB) is expected to be about $300 million and $5million, respectively, over the life of the proposed IFC investment, representing less than 0.09% and 0.01% of annual federal government revenues.

The World Bank assistance has been centered on development policy loans to support the governments reform agenda in the fiscal, financial, environmental and social sectors. Complementing this, the World Bank has also provided investment lending and grants in education, water, transportation infrastructure, rural development, renewable energy, urban services, assistance for forcibly displaced populations, and environment and natural resource management. IFC support includes: -  the strengthening and deepening of financial sector institutions and local financial markets; -  the development of infrastructure, including potential public-private partnerships and support to sub-national entities in the provision of infrastructure, in coordination with the Bank as warranted; -  investment in extractive industries; and -  the modernization of Colombian businesses to help improve their competitiveness and support their expansion both domestically and abroad. IFCs strategy for oil and gas aims to support local medium sized companies via equity and long term financing, while assuring that the projects meet high environmental, social, governance and transparency standards.Project Development Impact:The project will support the continuing development and growth of one of the few local companies with a presence in the Colombian oil and gas industry, where multinationals such as BP, Occidental and Petrobras, as well as Ecopetrol, the state owned oil and gas company,  currently dominate the oil and gas sector. Through the exploration and development of its existing licenses and acquisition of additional acreage, Kappa will contribute to the development of Colombia''s hydrocarbon natural resources and assist the country in maintaining it''s self-sufficiency.  Specifically, the project is anticipated to have the following developmental impacts: Creation and Preservation of Direct and Indirect Employment and Training:In 2005 Kappa employed directly and trained over 60 nationals. Over 200 jobs have also been generated via local services and suppliers. The Project will benefit the local community through increased employment opportunities, both directly and indirectly. DirectBenefits to Local Communities: Kappa places importance on sustainable development and quality of life improvement for those people affected by its operations. The Company is engaged in several social development and infrastructure projects, including supporting childrens education, medical services, water sanitation and infrastructure projects. Benefits to the Government: It is expected that the Government of Colombia will receive substantial receipts from royalties, production sharing and corporate taxes, generated by the project.Gas Flaring Reduction in Abanico: Kappas development plan for the Abanico field includes the utilization of the associated gas, which is currently being flared, to generate electricity for use in the field oil production process. The company may have excess gas production or electricity generation, which will be supplied to local consumers via an electric transmission line connecting to the national grid and a gas pipeline connecting to the gas distribution system.Gas Reserves Monetization in Cerrito:The projects gas exploration and production in Cerrito supports the monetization of stranded natural gas reserves in Colombia and secures an important uninterrupted source of clean energy to the residents of Cucuta, a city with a population of over 300,000 people, located in the State of Norte de Santander.  The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are:-	direct employment levels of Colombian nationals;-	implementation of community development programs;-	revenue payments to the Government of Colombia (GOC);-	gas flaring reduction in Abanico.Transparency and Governance ContextIn coming to a view of whether to support this Project, IFC has considered the value of the projects benefits, and governance and other risks to these benefits. As mentioned above, the project is expected to generate benefits in a variety of forms. Besides employment, local community development, gas flaring reduction, monetization of stranded gas reserves and uninterrupted gas supply to the city of Cucuta, it is expected that a large share of project benefits will accrue to the GOC in the form of royalties, production sharing and taxes. The Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (National Hydrocarbon Agency, ANH), the state regulatory agency for the oil and gas sector, publicly discloses on its website items such as: -  recent royalty information on a regional basis; and -  recent contract awards and term. Royalties paid on a regional basis are now also disclosed monthly in the local newspapers. Furthermore, to ensure transparency, all payments to the GOC will be publicly disclosed by Kappa in its website. In respect to governance, a range of governance indicators, including the current relationship between Colombia and the World Bank and IMF, have been considered. Colombia is seen as having relatively strong governance capacity in the Latin American region. In recent years, Colombia has made important progress in its Public Finance systems and improved transparency. Important initiatives include adoption of the 2002 presidential anticorruption plan, improving the administration of publicly owned banks, clarifying responsibilities for managing expenditures among different levels of government, and introducing modern accounting concepts and procedures. These initiatives were supported by the rollout of new information systems covering the budget and local government finances, as well as the monitoring of public procurement. The Government enacted an important Fiscal Transparency and Responsibility Law in 2003, and strengthened the disciplinary code for public servants. Based on the prevailing governance situations in Colombia, IFC believes the risks to project benefits not being realized, due to governance in Colombia, as relatively small."

"3931","Dewan Petroleum",24894,2006-05-04 04:00:00,"Middle East","The project will support development of discovered natural gas reserves in Pakistan and further investments towards exploration for new hydrocarbon reserves in the country. The sector is critical to Pakistans economy. Natural gas, a relatively more affordable and environmentally friendly fuel, currently meets about half of the countrys primary energy needs. Increasing domestic demand is projected to lead to supply deficits with the prospect of imports in the coming years. The gas supplied by the project is a relatively clean source of fuel and will be at significantly less cost than the alternative cost of imports. In addition to contributing to increased availability of a relatively cheaper and clean fuel, the projects additional development impacts will come from outlays in social programs, estimated, based on the concession agreement, to range at least between $20,000 to $75,000 annually depending on production levels; generating jobs and providing training; and in the form of incremental revenues to the governments from royalties, production bonuses and taxes, forecast at about $137 million over the twenty year life of the projects current proved reserves based on gas prices calculated using World Bank forecast oil prices.  IFC will track the projects development benefits annually based on information provided by DPL in respect of gas production, outlays on social development programs, creation of direct and indirect jobs, and revenues paid to the government and their agencies in Pakistan.  Governance Context Payments to the government from the project in the form of royalties and taxes are expected to be small, amounting to less than 0.1% of annual federal government revenues in Pakistan. While Pakistans performance on governance reveals weaknesses as evidenced by low scores on the Transparency International and World Bank Institute indicators, the country has made considerable progress in this area. Local governments have been created to increase responsiveness and accountability for provision of key public services, the tax administration bureaucracy is being overhauled, financial reporting and auditing systems have been modernized, and institutions of accountability like the Auditor General and the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committees have been revitalized. In the hydrocarbons sector, largely managed by the federal government, new legislation and regulations have been introduced, regulatory authorities have been established, and information dissemination (through website postings etc.) has been strengthened. In addition, revenue payments made by the company to the government and their agencies will be disclosed by the company on an annual basis.  Beyond revenue benefits discussed above, the project will also benefit domestic gas users by providing gas at a cost below that of non-gas alternative commercial fuels. Mandatory investments stipulated in the concession agreement in respect of social welfare programs will be made directly in coordination with the local civil administration or the relevant provincial government. Unspent amounts are otherwise to be deposited with these agencies. The partners intend to apply these directly in suitable social development programs; these expenditures will be tracked by the company annually.In coming to a view of whether to support this project, the IFC has considered the value of all of the projects benefits, and governance and other risks to these benefits. It has also considered in this respect a range of indicators of governance, and the current level of engagement between Pakistan and the World Bank and IMF. IFC believes the risks to project benefits not being realized, due to governance in the country, as relatively small. The non-revenue benefits which are significant, such as strengthening domestic energy production and provision of relatively clean and lower cost fuel, generating jobs and direct social welfare contribution are unlikely to be impacted by weak governance. The project is also consistent with overall World Bank Group objectives in Pakistans oil and gas sector, including helping strengthen local private sector participation in development of these sectors."

As of December 2005, mobile penetration in Pakistan was approximately 14.6% (just over 21 million mobile subscribers) and fixed line penetration was approximately 3.0% (4.5 million fixed line subscribers).  This project will enable Paktel to upgrade technology, increase capacity, and improve coverage, which will allow more consumers and businesses to have access to reliable and affordable telecommunications services in a country with very low teledensity.-  Extend geographic coverage:Paktel plans to add new sites to its network as it builds out past the main cities in Pakistan thereby extending service to the frontier and border areas of Pakistan.  - Support telecom liberalization agenda:As indicated by the telecommunications law passed in 1996 and the amendments and updates issued throughout 2003-2005 as well as the issuance of two new licenses to new entrants in 2004, the Government has committed to establishing best practices in telecommunications sector reform, including market liberalization in the mobile and fixed line sectors. The project will support private sector involvement and promote competition in the telecommunications sector which are goals of the Government. - Product & Service Innovation: Although Paktel is not the only mobile operator in Pakistan with foreign sponsors, its relationship with Millicom has resulted in several benefits including knowledge transfer for product and service innovation.  Paktel was the first operator in Pakistan to launch several services, including per second billing, and is looking to continue leading the market with innovative products and services best suited for Pakistan.  The project will enable Paktel to improve the quality and variety of services offered as its new GSM network will utilize SMS, GPRS and MMS services to enable multimedia and data applications.  - Demonstration Effect & Capital Mobilization:  As a result of past economic and political uncertainties, the climate for private sector investment in Pakistan has been challenging. The new governments efforts to improve macroeconomic management and public governance are encouraging, and an IFC investment at this time would show highly visible support for the administrations efforts to encourage private-sector investment. In addition, both the international and local commercial banks participating in the Paktel financing are looking to IFCs leadership role in providing financing to challenging emerging markets like Pakistan.

ISD-Ukraine does not depend on tariffs, especially as it is export oriented.  -  By implementing an action plan to meet IFCs environmental guidelines, the project should have a substantial positive impact on the environment by decreasing the emissions, improving the use of gases and better recycling of dust emissions.  -  Efforts by ISD, an industry leader, to improve transparency through having an international audit of its financial statements, will have far reaching effects on the business practices of the rest of the Ukrainian private sector, and the attitudes of foreign investors regarding Ukraine.-  Steel plants often have a huge impact on the local community by virtue of:--the large number of people directly employed, normally between 10,000 and 60,000 per plant; and --the historical dependence of nearby towns for services, especially in former Soviet Union and East Europe.  -  AMK and DMK are important to the development of the economies where the plants are located as they are town-creating enterprises and employ a significant portion of the regions workforce.  AMK and Alchevsk Cokes combined staff is 25,300.  AMK still supports some of the social infrastructure in the town of Alchevsk, with a population of about 190,000 people.  DMK with 19,000 employees is also one of the key employers in its town which has a population of 300,000."
