The planned expansion in China is expected to increase the Company's production by 30%. Employment Generation and Standards Setting:\n- Cambodia: The transfer of export-quality furniture manufacturing knowledge and technology from China to Cambodia will go hand in hand with creating jobs in Cambodia and improving the skill base of the local labor force, thus raising overall productivity in the sector. The Project is expected to help create viable long term skilled and semi-skilled direct labor opportunities for approximately 800 people at the Cambodian operating facility as well as additional employment along the supply chain. The Project is also expected to help the Company pursue an ethical work program and contribute to improved labor conditions in Cambodia though the application of IFC's Performance Standards.\n- China: A sizeable number of direct jobs will also be created in China as a result of the Project. The Company's operations are fairly labor-intensive and the new facilities will require about 2,200 new employees. Over the longer term, the number of jobs and their skills level may evolve if the Company undertakes the recommended automatization which would improve resource use efficiencies. The Project has the potential to generate market level impacts by supporting the development of the nascent furniture industry in Cambodia and helping to integrate the country into more diversified global value chains. In particular:\n- Cambodian industrial production is characterized by a narrow base, low level of technological sophistication, low value addition, and high concentration in only a few sectors (notably textiles and footwear, which represent approximately 80% of merchandise exports). Against this backdrop, a Chinese company diversifying its manufacturing base to Cambodia would help a country which is eager to both move up the manufacturing value chain as well as diversify over-reliance on textiles and garments. To help the country's manufacturing sector, Cambodian authorities have established the new Industrial Development Policy (IDP) 2015-2015, which provides a roadmap to boost investment and broaden the manufacturing base.\n- The proposed Project would build a new production facility in Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone (SSEZ) in line with IDP's vision. By undertaking a phased approach that starts with textile-based production (sofa covers) the Company is utilizing Cambodia's existing comparative advantages but is planning to invest in training and skill-building necessary to transition to furniture manufacturing and assembly. A successful outcome of the project is expected to demonstrate to international investors that Cambodia is a viable place of origin for high quality furniture and potentially attract new players.

Leasing has become the most important funding source for MSMEs as it is based on moveable assets, e.g. trucks, machines, equipment, in Lionbridge''s case. In the past, MSMEs could only rely on guarantee companies to get access to short term bank loans, which exposed them to volatility of funding, risk of sustainable operation given the mismatch in the tenure of funding and the life of operation machine/ equipment, as well as a bottleneck in expansion. The proposed project will effectively help Lionbridge Leasing diversify funding sources, improve funding stability and utilization, reach out to more MSMEs and expand credit to them. It is expected that Lionbridge will reach additional 20,000 MSMEs by 2020.\n2. Promoting healthy development of the financial leasing sector: the financial leasing industry in China is nascent and for a number of financial leasing companies, the transactions are related to shadow banking. On the contrary, Lionbridge was able to serve the underserved segment with a true leasing model, where the leases are repaid by the cash flow generated by the leasing asset. The success of Lionbridge will set a good example for the whole industry and help establish the right culture and mindset for the industry players, MSME clients, regulatory parties and investors, thus promote the long-run development of leasing sector in China.\n3. Job creation: the integrated logistics service will enable Lionbridge to recruit truck drivers to deliver the transportation services with Lionbridge''s trucks under financial lease model. Lionbridge has over 1,000 trucks now and targets to expand to 30,000 trucks in 3-5 years, which will create at least 30,000 jobs in the future.\n4. Promoting healthcare services in frontier regions: traditionally, HD services is not sufficient especially in the frontier region, where basic medical service has not fully covered yet.

Add energy generation capacity on the short term when Pakistan is facing severe power shortfalls: The Project is expected to generate 154GWh of energy (P50 case) providing additional power supply to approximately 186,000 customers annually and help address the significant supply deficit which generates regular blackouts in Pakistan. In addition, the Project is undertaken under the Upfront Tariff that has been determined in April 2014 and under which 580 MW of wind power projects have to achieve financial close by March 2015. IFC''s investment in the Project supports a newly issued tariff with the aim of bringing into operation 580 MW by the end of 2016.\n2. Support the development of Pakistan''s renewable energy sector: The Project will promote the use of renewable energy sources for power generation in Pakistan. As of today, wind power represents less than 1% of total generation capacity.\n3. Contribute to the diversification of Pakistan existing generation mix: Pakistan current energy mix is highly skewed towards thermal and fossil fuel based power generation sources (65% of the thermal sources consist of furnace oil and natural gas). The rapid depletion of indigenous gas resources and stalled development of large scale hydro or coal based generation capacity, have contributed to increase reliance on highly expensive imported oil which represents 37% of Pakistan generation mix as of today. The Project is not among the lowest sources of energy but as long as supply will lag behind demand, wind tariff will always be more competitive than highly expensive fuel oil based generation; ii) over the long run, as debt is being repaid, the tariff is one of the lowest cost generation sources of power in Pakistan; iii) from a portfolio perspective, wind power ensures long term stability of prices (no volatility related to fuel) and energy security of the country (no exposure to foreign exchange), both positive externalities that are not captured in the wind tariff but contribute to the top energy priorities set by the government of Pakistan.\n4. Contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions: The project is expected to generate carbon emission reduction (CERs) through the clean development mechanism of the Kyoto protocol: 68,065 (tCo2) per year is the expected GHG reduction.\n5. Support a local investor in the power sector: The Project emphasizes a strategic partnership and helps develop local expertise to aid future development of renewable energy in Pakistan. This is the second renewable project developed by the sponsors.\n6. Strong Impact on Private Sector Development and Economic Growth: Increasing access to power supply in Pakistan is critical to economic growth (estimated production losses of around 2-3% of GDP) by enabling power supply to the industrial sector and alleviating the pressure on government for subsidies and tariffs, which has been a driver for local currency depreciation.", "URL": "https://disclosures.ifc.org/project-detail/SII/35088/gul-ahmed-wind-limited"}, {"Project Number": "34552", "Company Name": "HEKSAGON KATI ATIK YONETIMI SANAYI VE TICARET ANONIM SIRKETI", "Date SPI Disclosed": "Nov 11, 2014", "Country": "Turkiye", "Region": "Central Asia and Turkiye", "Projected Board Date": "Dec 15, 2014", "Environmental Category": "B", "Status": "Completed", "Last Updated Date": "", "Department": "Gbl Infrastructure &amp; Natural Resources", "Industry": "Infrastructure", "Previous Events": "Approved : Mar 7, 2016", "Sector": "Waste to Energy - Waste", "Additional Project Attributes": "Invested: Oct 9, 2015", "Project Description": "Heksagon Kati Atik A.S.

Improving Water Sanitation and Wastewater Reuse in Emerging Markets: Organica''s wastewater treatment (WWT) technology offers a highly cost competitive, space saving, and decentralized solution to customers. This technology application is particularly attractive in the chosen emerging markets that Organica operates in, where a) urbanization and water quality issues are prevalent; b) WWT infrastructures are relatively new and stakeholders are relatively more open to adopting new WWT solutions; and c) increasing urban population density requires WWT solutions that minimizes footprint whilst aesthetically pleasing/ecosystem-like solutions allow for preservation of land value in the vicinity.\n\n2. Promoting a Decentralized and Distributed Wastewater Solution: In addition to driving resource efficiency on every level- lower energy usage, lower geographic footprint and lower infrastructure costs; Organica''s WWT solution is comprised of botanical garden like structures which blend into the urban landscape with no resemblance to traditional facilities. The sustainable look and feel as well as the smaller infrastructure footprint promote a decentralized and distributed approach towards WWT and contribute to a drive towards urban sustainability in emerging markets.\n\n3. Improving Effectiveness of Wastewater Treatment Solutions: Organica''s utilization of plant roots andits patented artificial media as a special biofilm carrier creates a more diverse and complex biological treatment system that improves treatment efficiency by maximizing oxygen transfer. This ultimately enhances the resilience of the WWT infrastructure against variations in treatment volume and wastewater quality variability.\n\n4. Stimulating Water Technologies Innovation and Resource Efficiency: Organica''s innovative biological treatment solution generates substantial savings in capital cost, operating cost, energy use and physical land use compared to conventional WWT technologies. IFC''s investment will stimulate technological innovation in WWT solutions that addresses energy and resource efficiencies, thereby strengthening its target market''s ability to delivery key infrastructure services and offer decentralized solutions.", "URL": "https://disclosures.ifc.org/project-detail/SII/32423/organica-water"}]
